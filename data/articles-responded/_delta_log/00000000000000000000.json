The anticipation of a slowdown in surgical procedures and devices used in abdomen surgeries due to the popularity of weight-loss drugs may overlook the broader societal factors contributing to these trends. The decision to undergo surgical procedures is multifaceted and involves considerations beyond just weight management, such as overall health, medical recommendations, and patient preferences.\\n3.

Zepbound was approved by the FDA last month for chronic weight management and helped people lose more weight than other approved weight loss drugs in clinical trials.\\n\\nTirzepatide is the main ingredient in Zepbound. It works by mimicking two hormone receptors, GIP and GLP-1. These hormones improve insulin sensitivity and help delay gastric emptying, meaning it takes longer for food to digest. This helps suppress the appetite, improves the feeling of fullness, and reduces hunger.\\n\\nNow, Zepbound comes in six different doses, ranging from 2.5 milligrams to 15 milligrams. Patients inject the medicine once weekly, either in the stomach, thigh, or upper arm. They start off with lower doses and gradually increase the amount over four to twenty weeks until they reach the right amount for treatment. In clinical trials, Zepbound helped people lose over 20% of their average weight after taking higher doses for 72 weeks. That averaged out to be about 52 pounds.\\n\\nTo be eligible, you must be an adult and classified as obese with a BMI \\u2013 body mass index \\u2013 higher than 30.

In the report, the investigators emphasized that the risk was very small.\\n\\nPrevious studies of GLP-1 drugs have noted an increased risk of these rare stomach disorders for diabetes patients. But this was the first time the risk was demonstrated in people taking the drugs for weight loss, researchers pointed out.\\n\\nThe study examined the health insurance claims of 613 patients on Novo\\u2019s semaglutide products and 4,144 patients on Novo\\u2019s GLP-1 liraglutide (Saxenda) from a large database of 16 million patients between 2006 and 2020.\\n\\nNovo's semaglutide is marketed as Ozempic for patients with diabetes and as Wegovy for those with obesity.

Gastroparesis, which is also called stomach paralysis or delayed gastric emptying, occurred in 1% of semaglutide users, compared to 0.7% of liraglutide patients.\\n\\nThere were no cases of bowel obstruction in patients on semaglutide, compared to a 0.8% rate for liraglutide users. Bowel obstruction is a mechanical blockage in the intestines.\\n\\nContrave users experienced gastroparesis at a 0.4% rate and pancreatitis and bowl obstruction at a 0.2% rate for each.\\n\\nThe research also showed there was no increased incidence of biliary disease for GLP-1 patients.\\n\\nOn the labels of Ozempic, Wegovy and Eli Lilly\\u2019s GLP-1 drug Mounjaro, the FDA already warns of another digestive condition\\u2014ileus, which is a non-mechanical blockage of the small intestine.\\n\\nLast month, when the warning was added to the label of Ozempic, a Novo spokesperson pointed out that the company\\u2019s GLP-1 drugs have been on the market for more than 15 years for diabetes and eight years for weight loss.\\n\\n\\u201cSemaglutide has been extensively examined in robust clinical development programs, large real world evidence studies and has cumulatively over 9.5 million patient years of exposure,\\u201d the Novo spokesperson wrote.\\n\\nAs demand for the drugs has skyrocketed, scrutiny of their side effects has ratcheted up.\\n\\nIn August, a Louisiana woman sued both Novo and Lilly, claiming that use of Ozempic and Mounjaro caused severe stomach problems.\\n\\nAt the time, a Novo spokesperson said gastrointestinal events are a \\\"well-known side effects of the GLP-1 class.\\\" Both companies said patient safety is a top priority.\\n\\n\\u201cFor semaglutide, the majority of GI side effects are mild to moderate in severity and of short duration,\\\" the Novo spokesperson added.\", \"article summary\": \"Previous studies of GLP-1 drugs have noted an increased risk of these rare stomach disorders for diabetes patients.\\nBut this was the first time the risk was demonstrated in people taking the drugs for weight loss, researchers pointed out.\\nThe research also showed there was no increased incidence of biliary disease for GLP-1 patients.\\nAt the time, a Novo spokesperson said gastrointestinal events are a \\\"well-known side effects of the GLP-1 class.\\\"\\n\\u201cFor semaglutide, the majority of GI side effects are mild to moderate in severity and of short duration,\\\" the Novo spokesperson added.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"weightloss\", \"sentiment_score\": \"9\", \"sentiment_explanation\": \"The sentiment score is high because the article highlights the challenges and negative impacts associated with the popularity and demand for Eli Lilly's medications, including supply shortages, limited availability, potential side effects, and high costs.\", \"negative_claims\": \"- The demand for Eli Lilly's medicines, especially Mounjaro, has outpaced drugmakers' capacity to manufacture them\\n- Patients experiencing difficulties in obtaining Mounjaro due to supply shortages\\n- Both Ozempic and Mounjaro have been on the FDA shortages list\\n- The medicines come with side effects, such as gastrointestinal issues and potential risk for more severe effects\\n- Insurance coverage for the medicines can be a challenge, and without it, they cost more than $1,000 a month out of pocket\\n- Hard choices for clinicians in prescribing decisions due to supply and insurance issues\\n- Patients struggling to find medications for long enough that they regain some of the weight they had previously lost\", \"__index_level_0__\": 5, \"counter_points\": \"1.

About a quarter is typically from the loss of lean mass, like muscle and bone, which is essential for metabolism and preventing injury as we age.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s true for weight loss from so-called GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy. For younger adults, the loss of muscle may not cause problems right away, but in people over 65, it\\u2019s critical for maintaining strength and mobility. Muscle weakness is a risk factor in falls among older adults, one of the leading causes of injury death for that age group, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As Medicare grapples with whether or not to cover the drugs for people 65 and older, studies of this population may be key.\\n\\n\\u201cWhile there may be many important benefits of weight loss metabolically, we need, particularly in older adults, to think about muscle and how important it is for the older adult population,\\u201d says John Batsis, an associate professor of medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine and Department of Nutrition at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. \\u201cLosing muscle mass and strength with aging is a natural phenomenon \\u2013 everyone though has a threshold where it causes a problem.\\u201d\\n\\nSo far, there\\u2019s not enough data to know just how big of a problem this is for older adults taking GLP-1 medications for weight loss, experts say. About 42% of US adults aged 60 and older have obesity, according to the CDC. In a clinical trial of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, researchers looked at loss of lean muscle mass in a subgroup of 140 participants. On average, participants lost about 15 pounds of lean muscle and 23 pounds of fat during the 68-week trial. However, the mean age of participants in that group was 52.\\n\\nBatsis says that very few GLP-1 studies, in general, have looked at differences between older and younger adults \\u2014 including how loss of fat and muscle may vary. And more studies focused on older adults are needed, he says.\\n\\nAlthough semaglutide reduced lean mass, patients lost even more fat, which helped improve their overall body composition, said Martin Havtorn Petersen, a spokesperson for Ozempic and Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk. He also said \\u201cthere has not been a safety signal identified in relation to loss of muscle mass.\\u201d\\n\\nDrugmakers are already looking at how next-generation weight loss drugs might be able to overcome this challenge. Eli Lilly & Co., for example, acquired obesity drug startup Versanis Bio for up to $2 billion in July, further extending the drugmaker\\u2019s reach into the weight loss market. Versanis\\u2019 experimental drug, bimagrumab, aims to help people lose weight while preserving their muscle mass.\\n\\nIt will be studied in combination with Lilly\\u2019s drug tirzepatide, which is expected to gain approval in obesity by year\\u2019s end. The combination \\u201ccould be the next major step in innovative treatments for those living with cardiometabolic diseases, like obesity,\\u201d Ruth Gimeno, Lilly\\u2019s vice president for diabetes, obesity and cardiometabolic research, said in a statement last month.\\n\\nFor older adults who may be taking weight loss medications, increasing protein intake, resistance exercises and other measures may help mitigate the loss of lean muscle, Batsis says.\", \"article summary\": \"It may come as a surprise, but not all weight loss is healthy.\\nThat\\u2019s true for weight loss from so-called GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy.\\nOn average, participants lost about 15 pounds of lean muscle and 23 pounds of fat during the 68-week trial.\\nAnd more studies focused on older adults are needed, he says.\\nFor older adults who may be taking weight loss medications, increasing protein intake, resistance exercises and other measures may help mitigate the loss of lean muscle, Batsis says.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"adults\", \"sentiment_score\": \"8\", \"sentiment_explanation\": \"The sentiment negativity score is 8 because the article highlights significant concerns and risks associated with the use of compounded versions of the diabetes drug Mounjaro.

US prescriptions for Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro surged 300% in just two years, putting the drugs on track to become some of the best-selling of all-time. The drugmakers are struggling to keep up with demand.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that Lilly and Novo aren\\u2019t promoting their drugs at all. From January to late November, Lilly and Novo have spent a combined $218 million on commercials for Ozempic and Mounjaro, diabetes drugs that have become popular for weight loss, according to iSpot.tv. But together they account for just 3.7% of the whopping $5.8 billion pharmaceutical companies have spent on TV ads overall this year. Wegovy, Novo\\u2019s weight-loss drug, hasn\\u2019t even yet had its national TV debut, according to iSpot.tv. The ads that have run for Ozempic and Mounjaro describe the drugs as medical interventions for people suffering from diabetes \\u2014 not a miracle diet drug that can help anyone get thin.\\n    \\n    - Sentiment Analysis:\\n        - Sentiment score: Eli Lilly Ozempic Risks\\n        - Sentiment explanation: \\n            The sentiment negativity score is high because the article portrays a frenzy over weight-loss drugs, indicating a potential over-reliance on pharmaceuticals for weight management.

People have even been using a drug like Ozempic, although it's only approved for diabetes, simply because it helps them lose weight.

This means that the flow of food in the body stops, which can cause continual vomiting. There have also been media reports of a higher risk of bowel obstruction with these drugs.\\n\\nOther potential side effects have been possibly linked to GLP-1 drugs, including suicidal thoughts.

Yet, these drugs are still in their relatively early growth stages; it can be difficult to know for certain what the long-term side effects may be -- and whether that might potentially deter people from using them in the future.\\n\\nWhile clinical studies often include thousands of people, many more people take approved drugs once they reach the market.
