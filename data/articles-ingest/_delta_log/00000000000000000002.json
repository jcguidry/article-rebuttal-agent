In particular, Novo Nordisk (NVO -2.05%) stands to gain tremendously as the maker of instant-classic obesity therapy Wegovy as well as the type 2 diabetes treatment Ozempic.\\n\\nHigh prescription medicine costs are doubtlessly a major impediment to reaching as much of the weight loss market as possible. But, according to the company's senior leadership, that shouldn't be much of a barrier for Wegovy specifically. Here's why.\\n\\nMedicine costs matter to consumers\\n\\nAmid what commentators rightly describe as an \\\"insatiable\\\" appetite for type 2 diabetes and weight loss therapies like Ozempic and Wegovy, Novo Nordisk, as well as its prime competitor in the space, Eli Lilly, expect to continue struggling to manufacture enough doses to meet demand for their star medicines for at least another year or so.\\n\\nWegovy alone brought in close to $1.4 billion in the third quarter, making it a significant component of Novo Nordisk's overall haul of $8.6 billion -- up 30% compared to a year prior. And there's a lot more where that came from. After all, Wegovy was only approved a little over two years ago, and it really only entered the public consciousness in the last 12 months when the company relaunched it in early 2023.\\n\\nPer comments by management, around 80% of the Americans taking Wegovy get their weekly shot for $25 or less, which works out to be an annual cost burden of $1,200. That means most people aren't paying anywhere near the drug's prohibitively expensive sticker price of $1,300 per month.\\n\\nIt also follows that as many as 50 million people in the U.S. could theoretically get their treatments covered by insurance. Deepening its penetration of such a huge market, which now seems inevitable, could easily bring billions more revenue for Novo Nordisk. And the very wide accessibility of the therapy is excellent news for shareholders, to say the least.\\n\\nThe company already revised its guidance for 2023 upward in October, and it's now expecting as much as a 38% gain in its sales year over year whereas before it anticipated a max of 33%.\\n\\nHard to see things slowing from here\\n\\nWegovy sales at their current level are enough for Novo Nordisk to rightfully claim that it's the global leader in diabetes treatment. While it might face some resistance in gaining even more market share due to competition from Eli Lilly, so far all the evidence points to the market being large enough to offer plenty of growth for both.\\n\\nNovo Nordisk is strongly profitable, with a profit margin in excess of 35%. In the trailing-12-month period, its sales were $31 billion. For its 2025 fiscal year, Wall Street analysts are estimating, on average, that it'll report sales of $45 billion. That's a runway of at least two years where the business will be growing very rapidly. And if one-upping of its own guidance proves to be a habit, its shares could easily keep outperforming the market.\\n\\nUntil demand for Wegovy is satisfied, and it probably won't be anytime soon, there isn't too much that might derail the gravy train. Of course, if previously unknown side effects or risks of treatment were come to light, the story could change.

Here\\u2019s a look at the latest research and why it could lead to lower prices for the expensive injections.\\n\\nMarleen Greenleaf, of Fort Washington, Maryland, shed more than 40 pounds taking Wegovy.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m not showing any signs of diabetes anymore. I\\u2019m more active. I can get out and do things I never considered doing,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nWe're making it easier for you to find stories that matter with our new newsletter \\u2014 The 4Front. Sign up here and get news that is important for you to your inbox.\\n\\nLisa Robillard, of Alexandria, Virginia, first took the medication as part of a clinical trial. After struggling with her weight since childhood, she lost 60 pounds.\\n\\n\\u201cFor the first time, I was leaving food on my plate. For the first time, I was, \\u2018OK, I\\u2019m full,\\u2019\\u201d she said.\\n\\nDr. Domenica Rubino, director of the Washington Center for Weight Management and Research in Arlington, took part in early research for the medications, before they hit the market.\\n\\n\\u201cWe were totally thrilled,\\u201d she said about the results.\\n\\nPatients\\u2019 average weight loss was 15%. The loss helps blood sugar, blood pressure and fatty liver disease, and helps reduce joint pain, Rubino said.\\n\\nOzempic and Wegovy are both made by Novo Nordisk and use a key ingredient called semaglutide. It targets an area in the brain that helps regulate your appetite and helps you feel fuller for longer.\\n\\n'What we really need is more tools'\\n\\nNow Rubino and her team are testing a new wave of medications to see if they can help people with chronic obesity lose even more weight.\\n\\n\\u201cThe results look very promising, and it looks like it's pushing us ahead of what we saw on the average weight loss for semaglutide,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe're actually seeing average weight loss of 20% or more. And a large number of people are able to get to 25%.\\u201d\\n\\nThe side effects of the medications already on the market can be nausea, vomiting, changes in vision and kidney problems. In serious cases, Ozempic and Wegovy could cause intestinal blockages, according to the drugs\\u2019 warning label.\\n\\nThat's why these clinical trials are so important.\\n\\nRubino\\u2019s center is actively recruiting people for four different trials. They\\u2019re looking at combinations of semaglutide with some newer gastrointestinal hormones that work to curb hunger.\\n\\nNew medications are still several years away from FDA approval, Rubino said. They could give doctors and patients more options.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat we really need is more tools, because you have to remember not everybody responds to the same drug. We are biologically different,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nWith more options could come better pricing. Weekly injections of Ozempic and Wegovy cost more than $1,000 per month and are typically not covered by insurance, making them out of reach for many Americans.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is about health,\\u201d Rubino said. \\u201cIt's not about weight loss. It's not about fitting into your designer dress. And I can't stress that enough. We change people's lives with these new medicines.\\u201d\\n\\nIn early November, the FDA approved a new weight loss drug.

New research strongly suggests a competing diabetes treatment from Eli Lilly (LLY 0.19%) is even better at helping patients manage their weight than the leading brand.\\n\\nRecently, researchers from a data analytics business called Truveta made big waves with an independent study that compared the effectiveness of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound.\\n\\nBoth drugs have been proven to help patients lose weight in individual clinical trials, but there haven't been any head-to-head studies. Truveta's findings don't carry as much authority as a clinical trial, and the data hasn't been peer reviewed. That said, it's still the most direct comparison of these two drugs we've seen to date.\\n\\nWhat researchers found\\n\\nTruveta compared the electronic health records (EHR) of 18,386 patients who were prescribed Novo Nordisk's (NVO -2.05%) semaglutide or Eli Lilly's tirzepatide. The results strongly suggest that Lilly's drug has the upper hand.\\n\\nDrug 5% Weight Reduction 10% Weight Reduction 15% Weight Reduction Tirzepatide 81.8% 62.6% 42.3% Semaglutide 64.6% 38% 19.3%\\n\\nAfter a year of treatment, patients were more than twice as likely to experience a 15% weight reduction with Lilly's treatment.\\n\\nBoth groups lost weight, but patients taking tirzepatide lost a lot more. At their 12-month checkups, patients prescribed tirzepatide achieved weight reductions that were 7.2% greater than the semaglutide group.\\n\\nLooking ahead\\n\\nIn the third quarter, Mounjaro sales reached an annualized $5.6 billion. This is outstanding for a treatment that earned its first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to treat type 2 diabetes in May of 2022.\\n\\nTirzepatide sales, however, are probably just getting started. A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 45% of the public is interested in taking a prescription weight-loss drug.\\n\\nEli Lilly's tirzepatide sales will likely see a big bump in 2024. The FDA recently approved it for chronic weight management under the brand name Zepbound.\\n\\nPreviously, folks seeking weight-management treatment who didn't have type-2 diabetes needed to find a physician who would prescribe Mounjaro off-label. Zepbound's approval for the chronic weight-management indication specifically should make it far easier to access.\\n\\nWith immense levels of demand in mind, analysts at JPMorgan have raised eyebrows by estimating $50 billion in annual sales of Lilly's weight-management drugs by 2030.\\n\\nOf course, Eli Lilly is a huge pharmaceutical company made of many pieces that don't always travel in the same direction. Weight-management sales could be off the charts, but they'll need to offset some significant losses. Third-quarter sales of Alimta, Humalog, and Trulicity all fell more than 10% year over year. Combined, these drugs are still responsible for about 22% of the company's total revenue.\\n\\nTime to buy Eli Lilly?\\n\\nA great deal of success for its weight-management drugs is already baked into Eli Lilly's stock price. At the moment, it's trading at the sky-high multiple of 89x forward-looking earnings estimates.\\n\\nTirzepatide sales will most likely wipe the floor with semaglutide. Before adding Eli Lilly's stock to their portfolios, though, investors should understand the stock will tank if tirzepatide sales don't consistently meet elevated expectations.\\n\\nI wouldn't bet against Eli Lilly right now, but the stock is too risky at its inflated valuation.

Earlier this month, Florida judge William Jung gave Novo three weeks to renew its complaint against Brooksville.\\n\\nIn addition, Novo is suing another Florida company, Wells Pharmacy. In both complaints, Novo says that the companies are selling adulterated versions of the treatments that contain BPC-157, a peptide that promotes gastrointestinal healing but has not been sanctioned for use in compounded products because of safety risks.\\n\\nIn September, the FDA clarified its ban on BPC-157, saying it would \\u201cconsider taking action against a compounder\\u201d for using it or other bulk drug substances in its classification.\\n\\nNovo also says that the compounded versions from Wells and Brooksville contain at least 19% less semaglutide\\u2014the active ingredient in Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus\\u2014than promised on their labels.\\n\\n\\u201cCompounded products do not have the same safety, quality and effectiveness assurances as FDA-approved drugs, and adulterated and misbranded injectable compounded drugs may expose patients to significant health risks,\\u201d Jason Brett, Novo\\u2019s executive director of medical affairs, said in a release.\\n\\nThe complaints continue a feud between Novo Nordisk and companies accused of selling unauthorized versions of GLP-1 drugs.

A month later, Novo alleged that four more companies, including Brooksville, were doing the same.\\n\\nIn September, Eli Lilly got into the act, filing lawsuits against eight companies in the U.S. who are accused of producing or selling compounded versions of the popular GLP-1/GIP drug Mounjaro. A month later, Lilly went after 11 online pharmacies, including several overseas, that are allegedly importing, selling or distributing unauthorized versions of Mounjaro.\\n\\nIn May, in warning consumers about unauthorized versions of the weight loss drugs, the FDA explained that some pharmacies are permitted to make compounded versions of treatments that are having supply shortages. But in the rush to provide these highly demanded medications, some pharmacies are making versions with unauthorized ingredients.\\n\\nAs demand has increased for the weight loss drugs, sales have skyrocketed. In the third quarter, Lilly (38%) and Novo (29%) posted the largest year-over-year revenue increases in the industry.

For more than a decade, research has emerged that similar drugs used to treat diabetes have a surprising side-effect: They make people want to drink less alcohol\\u2014way less.\\n\\nThe apparent effectiveness of drugs like semaglutide won\\u2019t come as a surprise to doctors who have been prescribing these drugs to patients for years. In 2011, researchers in India found that a drug called liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor used to treat diabetes, significantly reduced alcohol intake in a small group of patients. In fact, nine of the 63 participants surveyed had stopped drinking altogether.\\n\\nHints that these kinds of drugs could be used in the treatment of alcoholism go back even further. The first GLP-1 receptor agonist came on the market back in 2005 in the form of exenatide, and the accompanying waning thirst for alcohol has been reported anecdotally over and over ever since. \\u201cSome of [the patients] wanted to have a break going on holidays, because they wanted to be able to enjoy a glass of red wine,\\u201d says Mette Kruse Klausen, a postdoctoral researcher at the Psychiatric Centre Copenhagen in Denmark. If it were the case that this already-approved, safe drug could stem alcohol cravings, its potential to treat alcohol use disorder, or AUD\\u2014estimated to afflict over 280 million people worldwide\\u2014was tantalizing.\\n\\nFollow-up research was slow. First, researchers had to test the application out on animals, which they did\\u2014and it did show promise in using GLP-1 receptor agonists for reducing alcohol intake.\\n\\nResearch in humans followed: A randomized clinical trial in Denmark led by Kruse Klausen started in 2017 looking at treating patients with AUD with exenatide. It worked with 127 patients with AUD; half got exenatide, half a placebo. A setback followed: Researchers found that exenatide did not lead to a reduction in the number of heavy-drinking days between the two groups.\\n\\nResearchers working on the study theorized that the lack of efficacy could have been due to the cognitive behavioral therapy offered to both groups. Another factor could have been that severity of the patients\\u2019 AUD was lower than that of other trials looking at treatments for AUD\\u2014and research on interventions for people with AUD is just difficult to do, says Kruse Klausen, due to the high dropout rate. Another analysis of the data found that the drug was effective at significantly reducing alcohol intake\\u2013but only in the participants who qualified as obese.\\n\\nAnother reason for the trial\\u2019s failure could be that exenatide is much less potent than its newer cousin semaglutide, better known as Ozempic.

In the last three months of 2022, as #Ozempicweightloss was racking up more than 85 million views on TikTok, physicians wrote more than 9 million new GLP-1 prescriptions, according to a report.\\n\\nAs of Nov. 21, TikToks with #Ozempicweightloss have been viewed more than 421 million times.\\n\\n\\\"In weight loss surgery or medicine too, there's always a gravitation to what's the sexy new thing,\\\" said Tim Schaffner, MD, bariatric surgeon at Bon Secours in Hampton Roads, Va.\\n\\nDexter Turnquest, MD, a bariatric surgeon at Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital, said obesity is too complex of a disease to warrant the drugs to be \\\"indiscriminately passed out\\\" without other chronic weight loss management, such as correcting exercise and diet.\\n\\nPrescribing a medication off-label isn't uncommon, but the rapid increase in these scripts has surgeons concerned about future findings.

Thompson, MD, director of endoscopy for Boston-based Brigham and Women's Hospital and co-director of its Center for Weight Management and Wellness, both wonder about the cost-benefit balance between GLP-1s \\u2014 which can be hundreds of dollars a month \\u2014 and weight loss surgeries \\u2014 which are more expensive upfront.\\n\\nDr. Schaffner said the \\\"ultimate question\\\" is whether patients taking GLP-1s keep the intended weight off long-term. Alfred Trang, MD, medical director of general surgery for Livonia, Mich.-based Trinity Health Mid-Atlantic, agrees.\\n\\n\\\"I am concerned that the medication slows down gastric emptying, and so to what extent, how permanent it is, these things we don't know yet,\\\" Dr. Trang said. \\\"The studies out there, the [longest] study was only about 68 weeks.

Zepbound was approved by the FDA last month for chronic weight management and helped people lose more weight than other approved weight loss drugs in clinical trials.\\n\\nTirzepatide is the main ingredient in Zepbound. It works by mimicking two hormone receptors, GIP and GLP-1. These hormones improve insulin sensitivity and help delay gastric emptying, meaning it takes longer for food to digest. This helps suppress the appetite, improves the feeling of fullness, and reduces hunger.\\n\\nNow, Zepbound comes in six different doses, ranging from 2.5 milligrams to 15 milligrams. Patients inject the medicine once weekly, either in the stomach, thigh, or upper arm. They start off with lower doses and gradually increase the amount over four to twenty weeks until they reach the right amount for treatment. In clinical trials, Zepbound helped people lose over 20% of their average weight after taking higher doses for 72 weeks. That averaged out to be about 52 pounds.\\n\\nTo be eligible, you must be an adult and classified as obese with a BMI \\u2013 body mass index \\u2013 higher than 30. You\\u2019re also eligible if you\\u2019re overweight with at least one weight-related medical problem such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, heart disease, or high cholesterol levels in the blood.\\n\\nEli Lilly\\u2019s new release says they don't know if Zepbound is safe and effective when used alongside other prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal weight loss products. They also state that patients should not use Zepbound with other tirzepatide-containing products or any GLP-1 receptor agonist medicines. And that includes Ozempic and Wegovy.\\n\\nAs for warnings, Eli Lilly reports that Zepbound may cause tumors in the thyroid, including thyroid cancer. Other possible serious side effects include:\\n\\nSevere stomach problems\\n\\nKidney problems including kidney failure\\n\\nInflammation of the pancreas\\n\\nGallbladder problems\\n\\nLow blood sugar\\n\\nVision changes in patients with type 2 diabetes\\n\\nDepression or thoughts of suicide and\\n\\nSerious allergic reactions\\n\\nGiven these potential risks, it\\u2019s very important that people have an open discussion with their doctor to weigh the pros and cons of using this medication.\\n\\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that while Zepbound has proven effective for weight loss, Eli Lilly advises patients to maintain a reduced-calorie diet and increase physical activity. This means it's still important to prioritize a balanced lifestyle to keep your body healthy.\", \"article summary\": \"\\\"What we can see big picture is that there's some shifting in categories as people think about losing weight,\\\" Chief Executive Doug McMillon told CNBC in an interview.\\nSo there's some movement around, but I can't call what's gonna happen in the long term.\\nMany other drug companies are working to develop oral versions - for now they are only available as injectables.\\nFor more, read: The dark side of the weight-loss-drug craze: eating disorders, medication shortages, dangerous knockoffs-Ciara LinnaneThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.
