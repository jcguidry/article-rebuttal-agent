In the report, the investigators emphasized that the risk was very small.\\n\\nPrevious studies of GLP-1 drugs have noted an increased risk of these rare stomach disorders for diabetes patients. But this was the first time the risk was demonstrated in people taking the drugs for weight loss, researchers pointed out.\\n\\nThe study examined the health insurance claims of 613 patients on Novo\\u2019s semaglutide products and 4,144 patients on Novo\\u2019s GLP-1 liraglutide (Saxenda) from a large database of 16 million patients between 2006 and 2020.\\n\\nNovo's semaglutide is marketed as Ozempic for patients with diabetes and as Wegovy for those with obesity.

Gastroparesis, which is also called stomach paralysis or delayed gastric emptying, occurred in 1% of semaglutide users, compared to 0.7% of liraglutide patients.\\n\\nThere were no cases of bowel obstruction in patients on semaglutide, compared to a 0.8% rate for liraglutide users. Bowel obstruction is a mechanical blockage in the intestines.\\n\\nContrave users experienced gastroparesis at a 0.4% rate and pancreatitis and bowl obstruction at a 0.2% rate for each.\\n\\nThe research also showed there was no increased incidence of biliary disease for GLP-1 patients.\\n\\nOn the labels of Ozempic, Wegovy and Eli Lilly\\u2019s GLP-1 drug Mounjaro, the FDA already warns of another digestive condition\\u2014ileus, which is a non-mechanical blockage of the small intestine.\\n\\nLast month, when the warning was added to the label of Ozempic, a Novo spokesperson pointed out that the company\\u2019s GLP-1 drugs have been on the market for more than 15 years for diabetes and eight years for weight loss.\\n\\n\\u201cSemaglutide has been extensively examined in robust clinical development programs, large real world evidence studies and has cumulatively over 9.5 million patient years of exposure,\\u201d the Novo spokesperson wrote.\\n\\nAs demand for the drugs has skyrocketed, scrutiny of their side effects has ratcheted up.\\n\\nIn August, a Louisiana woman sued both Novo and Lilly, claiming that use of Ozempic and Mounjaro caused severe stomach problems.\\n\\nAt the time, a Novo spokesperson said gastrointestinal events are a \\\"well-known side effects of the GLP-1 class.\\\" Both companies said patient safety is a top priority.\\n\\n\\u201cFor semaglutide, the majority of GI side effects are mild to moderate in severity and of short duration,\\\" the Novo spokesperson added.\", \"article summary\": \"Previous studies of GLP-1 drugs have noted an increased risk of these rare stomach disorders for diabetes patients.\\nBut this was the first time the risk was demonstrated in people taking the drugs for weight loss, researchers pointed out.\\nThe research also showed there was no increased incidence of biliary disease for GLP-1 patients.\\nAt the time, a Novo spokesperson said gastrointestinal events are a \\\"well-known side effects of the GLP-1 class.\\\"\\n\\u201cFor semaglutide, the majority of GI side effects are mild to moderate in severity and of short duration,\\\" the Novo spokesperson added.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"weightloss\"}, \"nullCount\": {\"title\": 0, \"description\": 0, \"published date\": 0, \"url\": 0, \"publisher.href\": 0, \"publisher.title\": 0, \"query end date\": 0, \"published datetime\": 0, \"article text\": 0, \"article html\": 0, \"article summary\": 0, \"article keywords.list.item\": 0}}","tags":null,"deletionVector":null,"baseRowId":null,"defaultRowCommitVersion":null,"clusteringProvider":null}}

About a quarter is typically from the loss of lean mass, like muscle and bone, which is essential for metabolism and preventing injury as we age.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s true for weight loss from so-called GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy. For younger adults, the loss of muscle may not cause problems right away, but in people over 65, it\\u2019s critical for maintaining strength and mobility. Muscle weakness is a risk factor in falls among older adults, one of the leading causes of injury death for that age group, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As Medicare grapples with whether or not to cover the drugs for people 65 and older, studies of this population may be key.\\n\\n\\u201cWhile there may be many important benefits of weight loss metabolically, we need, particularly in older adults, to think about muscle and how important it is for the older adult population,\\u201d says John Batsis, an associate professor of medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine and Department of Nutrition at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. \\u201cLosing muscle mass and strength with aging is a natural phenomenon \\u2013 everyone though has a threshold where it causes a problem.\\u201d\\n\\nSo far, there\\u2019s not enough data to know just how big of a problem this is for older adults taking GLP-1 medications for weight loss, experts say. About 42% of US adults aged 60 and older have obesity, according to the CDC. In a clinical trial of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, researchers looked at loss of lean muscle mass in a subgroup of 140 participants. On average, participants lost about 15 pounds of lean muscle and 23 pounds of fat during the 68-week trial. However, the mean age of participants in that group was 52.\\n\\nBatsis says that very few GLP-1 studies, in general, have looked at differences between older and younger adults \\u2014 including how loss of fat and muscle may vary. And more studies focused on older adults are needed, he says.\\n\\nAlthough semaglutide reduced lean mass, patients lost even more fat, which helped improve their overall body composition, said Martin Havtorn Petersen, a spokesperson for Ozempic and Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk. He also said \\u201cthere has not been a safety signal identified in relation to loss of muscle mass.\\u201d\\n\\nDrugmakers are already looking at how next-generation weight loss drugs might be able to overcome this challenge. Eli Lilly & Co., for example, acquired obesity drug startup Versanis Bio for up to $2 billion in July, further extending the drugmaker\\u2019s reach into the weight loss market. Versanis\\u2019 experimental drug, bimagrumab, aims to help people lose weight while preserving their muscle mass.\\n\\nIt will be studied in combination with Lilly\\u2019s drug tirzepatide, which is expected to gain approval in obesity by year\\u2019s end. The combination \\u201ccould be the next major step in innovative treatments for those living with cardiometabolic diseases, like obesity,\\u201d Ruth Gimeno, Lilly\\u2019s vice president for diabetes, obesity and cardiometabolic research, said in a statement last month.\\n\\nFor older adults who may be taking weight loss medications, increasing protein intake, resistance exercises and other measures may help mitigate the loss of lean muscle, Batsis says.\", \"article summary\": \"It may come as a surprise, but not all weight loss is healthy.\\nThat\\u2019s true for weight loss from so-called GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy.\\nOn average, participants lost about 15 pounds of lean muscle and 23 pounds of fat during the 68-week trial.\\nAnd more studies focused on older adults are needed, he says.\\nFor older adults who may be taking weight loss medications, increasing protein intake, resistance exercises and other measures may help mitigate the loss of lean muscle, Batsis says.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"adults\"}, \"maxValues\": {\"title\": \"Weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy may be risky for older people because they melt away all-important muscles, experts say - Fortune\", \"description\": \"Weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy may be risky for older people because they melt away all-important muscles, experts say  Fortune\", \"published date\": \"2023-09-27\", \"url\": \"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGxpbmUuY29tL2hlYWx0aC1uZXdzL2VsaS1saWxseS1zdWluZy1jb21wYW5pZXMtc2VsbGluZy1rbm9ja29mZi12ZXJzaW9ucy1vZi1vemVtcGljLWxpa2UtZHJ1Zy1tb3VuamFyb9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en\", \"publisher.href\": \"https://www.healthline.com\", \"publisher.title\": \"Healthline\", \"query end date\": \"2023-12-13T02:07:22.818228\", \"published datetime\": \"2023-09-27T07:00:00\", \"article text\": \"\", \"article summary\": \"Share on Pinterest Eli Lilly, maker of the Ozempic-like drug Mounjaro, is suing clinics that are selling knockoff versions of the medication.\\nSandy Huffaker for The Washington Post via Getty Images Eli Lilly is suing several companies for making knockoff versions of its popular diabetes drug Mounjaro.\\nThey suggest working with your doctor to ensure that compounded drugs are safe and effective for you.\\nOn September 19, drug maker Eli Lilly announced it had filed lawsuits against several companies selling compounded versions of its type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro.\\nIncluded in the suits are 10 medical spas, wellness clinics, and compounding pharmacies across the U.S.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"weightloss\"}, \"nullCount\": {\"title\": 0, \"description\": 0, \"published date\": 0, \"url\": 0, \"publisher.href\": 0, \"publisher.title\": 0, \"query end date\": 0, \"published datetime\": 0, \"article text\": 0, \"article html\": 0, \"article summary\": 0, \"article keywords.list.item\": 0}}","tags":null,"deletionVector":null,"baseRowId":null,"defaultRowCommitVersion":null,"clusteringProvider":null}}

People have even been using a drug like Ozempic, although it's only approved for diabetes, simply because it helps them lose weight. In just the last three months of 2022, there were over 9 million prescriptions issued in the U.S. for weight-loss drugs. In less than three years, the number of prescriptions has soared by 300%.\\n\\nPeople have been rushing out to use weight-loss drugs -- and shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO -0.46%), the company which makes Ozempic, have also jumped over 150% in three years. But there could be one big risk with Ozempic and other, similar drugs, and that's the side effects.\\n\\nReports of concerning side effects\\n\\nIn Canada, at the University of British Columbia, researchers concluded in an epidemiological study that Ozempic -- along with other GLP-1 receptor agonists that aim to subdue a person's appetite -- may lead to increased risk of stomach paralysis. This means that the flow of food in the body stops, which can cause continual vomiting. There have also been media reports of a higher risk of bowel obstruction with these drugs.\\n\\nOther potential side effects have been possibly linked to GLP-1 drugs, including suicidal thoughts. In Europe, regulators are also concerned about whether they may increase the risk of thyroid cancer.\\n\\nOf course, it's important to remember that these medications have passed rigorous regulatory approval. Yet, these drugs are still in their relatively early growth stages; it can be difficult to know for certain what the long-term side effects may be -- and whether that might potentially deter people from using them in the future.\\n\\nWhile clinical studies often include thousands of people, many more people take approved drugs once they reach the market. And at a larger scale, more outlier symptoms and side effects could arise that may not have been identified as risks in clinical trials.\\n\\nAnother risk for Novo Nordisk\\n\\nA separate risk for Novo Nordisk is simply the potential competition ahead. Depending on how its products stack up against other drugs and weight-loss treatments, that could drastically affect their growth potential. People will naturally want to take the drugs that achieve the highest rate of weight loss.\\n\\nPharmaceutical competitor Eli Lilly is working on getting Mounjaro, a treatment for diabetes, approved as a weight-loss drug; in clinical trials, it has shown that it can help people lose even more weight than Wegovy and Ozempic. Pfizer has also been working on danuglipron, a weight-loss pill which has achieved comparable results to Ozempic, although at a much higher dosage.\\n\\nWegovy and Ozempic accounted for half of Novo Nordisk's revenue through the first half of this year. That percentage is likely to rise as the drugs continue to grow in popularity and as the company rolls out Wegovy to more markets. The success of both the company and the stock may inevitably be linked to the success of these two drugs.\\n\\nShould you buy Novo Nordisk shares?\\n\\nReports of potential side effects involving GLP-1 drugs are concerning, but as of now shouldn't derail Novo Nordisk's growth prospects. Since there's been a huge jump in prescriptions, with millions being issued in the U.S. alone, if there was a huge immediate issue with these drugs, it would likely be well-known by now.\\n\\nMany people are desperate for effective weight-loss options, and it is a reality that most drugs come with side effects. For now, this isn't a huge risk for Novo Nordisk, but it is one that investors should keep an eye on as more data comes out. Overall, Novo Nordisk is still a terrific growth-oriented company to invest in. It could continue to generate great returns in the long run.\", \"article summary\": \"Weight-loss drugs have been soaring in popularity over the past few years.\\nIn just the last three months of 2022, there were over 9 million prescriptions issued in the U.S. for weight-loss drugs.\\nPeople have been rushing out to use weight-loss drugs -- and shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO -0.46%), the company which makes Ozempic, have also jumped over 150% in three years.\\nBut there could be one big risk with Ozempic and other, similar drugs, and that's the side effects.\\nAnother risk for Novo NordiskA separate risk for Novo Nordisk is simply the potential competition ahead.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"widespread\"}, \"nullCount\": {\"title\": 0, \"description\": 0, \"published date\": 0, \"url\": 0, \"publisher.href\": 0, \"publisher.title\": 0, \"query end date\": 0, \"published datetime\": 0, \"article text\": 0, \"article html\": 0, \"article summary\": 0, \"article keywords.list.item\": 0}}","tags":null,"deletionVector":null,"baseRowId":null,"defaultRowCommitVersion":null,"clusteringProvider":null}}

A month later, Lilly went after 11 online pharmacies, including several overseas, that are allegedly importing, selling or distributing unauthorized versions of Mounjaro.\\n\\nIn May, in warning consumers about unauthorized versions of the weight loss drugs, the FDA explained that some pharmacies are permitted to make compounded versions of treatments that are having supply shortages. But in the rush to provide these highly demanded medications, some pharmacies are making versions with unauthorized ingredients.\\n\\nAs demand has increased for the weight loss drugs, sales have skyrocketed. In the third quarter, Lilly (38%) and Novo (29%) posted the largest year-over-year revenue increases in the industry. During the period, Ozempic and Wegovy combined for $4.7 billion in sales, which accounted for 57% of Novo\\u2019s revenue. Meanwhile, Mounjaro\\u2019s sales reached $1.4 billion in the quarter.\", \"article summary\": \"Seven weeks after a federal judge dismissed (PDF) a Novo Nordisk\\u2019s lawsuit, which accused a Florida pharmacy of selling unauthorized knockoffs of its GLP-1 drugs Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus, Novo has sued the same company.\\nThe complaints continue a feud between Novo Nordisk and companies accused of selling unauthorized versions of GLP-1 drugs.\\nIn September, Eli Lilly got into the act, filing lawsuits against eight companies in the U.S. who are accused of producing or selling compounded versions of the popular GLP-1/GIP drug Mounjaro.\\nA month later, Lilly went after 11 online pharmacies, including several overseas, that are allegedly importing, selling or distributing unauthorized versions of Mounjaro.\\nAs demand has increased for the weight loss drugs, sales have skyrocketed.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"wegovy\"}, \"nullCount\": {\"title\": 0, \"description\": 0, \"published date\": 0, \"url\": 0, \"publisher.href\": 0, \"publisher.title\": 0, \"query end date\": 0, \"published datetime\": 0, \"article text\": 0, \"article html\": 0, \"article summary\": 0, \"article keywords.list.item\": 0}}","tags":null,"deletionVector":null,"baseRowId":null,"defaultRowCommitVersion":null,"clusteringProvider":null}}

However, in recent years Ozempic has been increasingly prescribed for weight loss. Therefore, the drug maker introduced Wegovy, which contains the same active ingredient and is approved for weight loss, and both drugs have been aggressively marketed as safe and effective treatments.\\n\\nThe drugs are part of a class of medications known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, which also includes Trulicity, Byetta and others. However, there is now increasing evidence of a serious risk of stomach problems from Ozempic, Wegovy and other members of the class, which can cause permanent delays in gastric emptying, leaving users with painful long-term gastrointestinal damage.\\n\\nAccording to allegations raised in Ozempic stomach paralysis lawsuits filed in recent months, Novo Nordisk has placed a desire for profits before consumer safety, by promoting use of the drug for weight loss, without disclosing the risks users may face.\\n\\nFDA Investigators Identified Problems at Ozempic, Wegovy Facility\\n\\nThe recent report by Fierce Pharma outlines findings from an FDA Form 483 inspection report, which the site was able to obtain. In it, FDA inspectors found \\u201cobjectionable organisms\\u201d on three separate occasions in batches of semaglutide, which they say Novo Nordisk failed to properly investigate.\\n\\nThe FDA reportedly cited the facility for the failure to investigate and the failure to put in place adequate microbial contamination controls. Inspectors indicated Novo Nordisk had not established microbial limits for semaglutide being processed at the plant.\\n\\nMicrobial contamination could lead to infections and other adverse health consequences for consumers should those organisms be dangerous and if they were distributed to the public.\\n\\nThe Form 483 report has yet to be released to the public.\\n\\nOzempic and Wegovy Stomach Paralysis Lawsuits\\n\\nIn late June, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) issued new Ozempic and Wegovy surgery guidelines that warned against using the drugs before elective surgery, due to the risk of vomiting and aspiration during anesthesia. However, some anesthesiologists say the guidelines do not go far enough to protect patients.\\n\\nGastroparesis, also known as delayed gastric emptying or stomach paralysis, weakens the normal muscle movement in the stomach. These stomach contractions are necessary to push food through the digestive tract.\\n\\nWhen gastroparesis occurs, the stomach is slow to empty, resulting in symptoms including nausea, vomiting undigested food, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, severe dehydration, feeling full after only a few bites, undigested food hardening in the stomach, acid reflux, fluctuating blood sugar levels, lack of appetite, weight loss, malnutrition and decreased quality of life.

However, in recent years Ozempic has been increasingly prescribed for weight loss. Therefore, the drug maker introduced Wegovy, which contains the same active ingredient and is approved for weight loss, and both drugs have been aggressively marketed as safe and effective treatments.\\n\\nThe drugs are part of a class of medications known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, which also includes Trulicity, Byetta and others. However, there is now increasing evidence of a serious risk of stomach problems from Ozempic, Wegovy and other members of the class, which can cause permanent delays in gastric emptying, leaving users with painful long-term gastrointestinal damage.\\n\\nAccording to allegations raised in Ozempic stomach paralysis lawsuits filed in recent months, Novo Nordisk has placed a desire for profits before consumer safety, by promoting use of the drug for weight loss, without disclosing the risks users may face.\\n\\nFDA Investigators Identified Problems at Ozempic, Wegovy Facility\\n\\nThe recent report by Fierce Pharma outlines findings from an FDA Form 483 inspection report, which the site was able to obtain. In it, FDA inspectors found \\u201cobjectionable organisms\\u201d on three separate occasions in batches of semaglutide, which they say Novo Nordisk failed to properly investigate.\\n\\nThe FDA reportedly cited the facility for the failure to investigate and the failure to put in place adequate microbial contamination controls. Inspectors indicated Novo Nordisk had not established microbial limits for semaglutide being processed at the plant.\\n\\nMicrobial contamination could lead to infections and other adverse health consequences for consumers should those organisms be dangerous and if they were distributed to the public.\\n\\nThe Form 483 report has yet to be released to the public.\\n\\nOzempic and Wegovy Stomach Paralysis Lawsuits\\n\\nIn late June, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) issued new Ozempic and Wegovy surgery guidelines that warned against using the drugs before elective surgery, due to the risk of vomiting and aspiration during anesthesia. However, some anesthesiologists say the guidelines do not go far enough to protect patients.\\n\\nGastroparesis, also known as delayed gastric emptying or stomach paralysis, weakens the normal muscle movement in the stomach. These stomach contractions are necessary to push food through the digestive tract.\\n\\nWhen gastroparesis occurs, the stomach is slow to empty, resulting in symptoms including nausea, vomiting undigested food, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, severe dehydration, feeling full after only a few bites, undigested food hardening in the stomach, acid reflux, fluctuating blood sugar levels, lack of appetite, weight loss, malnutrition and decreased quality of life. However, some users are reporting these side effects persisted long after Wegovy or Ozempic are discontinued.\\n\\nIn July, a CNN investigation outlined an alarming number of reports linking Ozempic and stomach paralysis, indicating that similar problems have been associated with other drugs in the same class in recent years.\\n\\nIn 2017, researchers with the Mayo Clinic conducted a study involving a similar diabetes medication known as Victoza, which found that the drug caused significantly slower digestion in users, taking about 70 minutes for half the food they ate to leave their stomachs, compared to four minutes for people who did not take the drug.
