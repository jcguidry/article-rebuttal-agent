Here\\u2019s a look at the latest research and why it could lead to lower prices for the expensive injections.\\n\\nMarleen Greenleaf, of Fort Washington, Maryland, shed more than 40 pounds taking Wegovy.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m not showing any signs of diabetes anymore. I\\u2019m more active. I can get out and do things I never considered doing,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nWe're making it easier for you to find stories that matter with our new newsletter \\u2014 The 4Front. Sign up here and get news that is important for you to your inbox.\\n\\nLisa Robillard, of Alexandria, Virginia, first took the medication as part of a clinical trial. After struggling with her weight since childhood, she lost 60 pounds.\\n\\n\\u201cFor the first time, I was leaving food on my plate. For the first time, I was, \\u2018OK, I\\u2019m full,\\u2019\\u201d she said.\\n\\nDr. Domenica Rubino, director of the Washington Center for Weight Management and Research in Arlington, took part in early research for the medications, before they hit the market.\\n\\n\\u201cWe were totally thrilled,\\u201d she said about the results.\\n\\nPatients\\u2019 average weight loss was 15%. The loss helps blood sugar, blood pressure and fatty liver disease, and helps reduce joint pain, Rubino said.\\n\\nOzempic and Wegovy are both made by Novo Nordisk and use a key ingredient called semaglutide. It targets an area in the brain that helps regulate your appetite and helps you feel fuller for longer.\\n\\n'What we really need is more tools'\\n\\nNow Rubino and her team are testing a new wave of medications to see if they can help people with chronic obesity lose even more weight.\\n\\n\\u201cThe results look very promising, and it looks like it's pushing us ahead of what we saw on the average weight loss for semaglutide,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe're actually seeing average weight loss of 20% or more. And a large number of people are able to get to 25%.\\u201d\\n\\nThe side effects of the medications already on the market can be nausea, vomiting, changes in vision and kidney problems. In serious cases, Ozempic and Wegovy could cause intestinal blockages, according to the drugs\\u2019 warning label.\\n\\nThat's why these clinical trials are so important.\\n\\nRubino\\u2019s center is actively recruiting people for four different trials. They\\u2019re looking at combinations of semaglutide with some newer gastrointestinal hormones that work to curb hunger.\\n\\nNew medications are still several years away from FDA approval, Rubino said. They could give doctors and patients more options.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat we really need is more tools, because you have to remember not everybody responds to the same drug. We are biologically different,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nWith more options could come better pricing. Weekly injections of Ozempic and Wegovy cost more than $1,000 per month and are typically not covered by insurance, making them out of reach for many Americans.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is about health,\\u201d Rubino said. \\u201cIt's not about weight loss. It's not about fitting into your designer dress. And I can't stress that enough. We change people's lives with these new medicines.\\u201d\\n\\nIn early November, the FDA approved a new weight loss drug.

Recently, those warnings have ranged from the director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism suggesting Americans should limit themselves to two drinks per week to new European Union rules about wine labeling. But the wine industry is more concerned about something else: a drug named Ozempic.\\n\\nThe difference between government warnings and Ozempic is that people actually want to take the drug, which is made by the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk and can reduce the user's desire for alcohol at the same time as it eases feelings of hunger.\\n\\nOriginally designed for people with Type 2 diabetes, the drug has exploded in popularity among those hoping to lose weight and lose it fast. The drug costs roughly $900 a month, and many people are paying for it in cash if their insurance will not cover it, which is likely, since it is often used in an off-label manner. Unfortunately, the rapid demand has resulted in shortages for those who legitimately need the medication.\\n\\nNovo Nordisk created Ozempic, an injectable semaglutide, and its companion, Wegovy, in 2015, and released them in 2017. It soon became apparent that those taking it were losing weight fast. The drug does this in three ways: by helping the pancreas produce more insulin when one's blood sugar is high; by preventing the liver from producing too much sugar; and by slowing down food leaving the stomach.\\n\\nWine is a social beverage, and the industry\\u2019s assumption is that if an Ozempic user gathers with friends and does not drink, it\\u2019s likely others will not, as well\\u2014thus causing a decrease in consumption, and in wine sales. The New York Times recently ran a story examining the demographics of Ozempic users. What the newspaper found was that the drug was not as prevalent in Brooklyn, home to the highest number of the city's diabetics, as it was on the tony Upper East Side of Manhattan. The Times' research was not a scientific study, but instead developed by looking at ZIP codes where pharmacies dispense the drug.\\n\\nAccording to a story in The Washington Post, some experts are anticipating that the widespread use of Ozempic and other drugs could lead to an overall 1.8 percent decrease in American alcohol consumption\\u2014a $3.5 billion loss in sales for the alcohol industry.\\n\\nThe potential of these drugs to help societal problems such as alcoholism and obesity is enormous. However, there is a dark side. There are numerous lawsuits and aggressive attorneys pursuing liabilities. These drugs can allegedly cause stomach problems such as gastroparesis and ileus, and many lawsuits are now in the works. As always, it pays to consult a doctor before beginning any new medication.\\n\\nBob McGinn has spent his entire career in the wine industry\\u2014forming wine clubs, working in wine sales marketing and engaging in all facets of the winemaking process, including vine management, fermentation and yeast analysis. He has developed wine programs for companies such as Marriott, Sheraton and Smith & Wollensky, and consults with local restaurants.

The big drugmaker reported strong revenue and earnings growth in its second-quarter results. Its shares have jumped more than 50% year to date.\\n\\nThe story continues to get even better. Ozempic sales are skyrocketing faster than expected. That's obviously good for Novo Nordisk. Here's why it's also great news for Eli Lilly (LLY 0.19%) stock, which has soared even more than Novo Nordisk's shares have so far in 2023.\\n\\nHigher and higher\\n\\nLast week, Novo Nordisk raised its full-year outlook for 2023. The company now projects sales will jump between 32% and 38%, up from its previous guidance of sales growth of 27% to 33%. Novo also anticipates operating profit will increase between 40% and 46%. Its prior forecast was for operating profit growth of 31% to 37%.\\n\\nThere's no big surprise why Novo Nordisk is more optimistic about its full-year prospects. The company stated that the revised guidance reflects higher sales expectations for type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic and its sibling, weight-loss drug Wegovy.\\n\\nOzempic and Wegovy are different brand names for the same underlying drug-semaglutide. The key distinctions between the two are the indications for which they're approved and their dosage levels.\\n\\nDoctors can (and many often do) legally prescribe Ozempic for weight loss as well as for type 2 diabetes. Ozempic became wildly popular with celebrities publicly talking about their use of the drug to lose weight. This even led to supply shortages.\\n\\nHow Lilly benefits from Ozempic's success\\n\\nHow does Novo Nordisk's greater expectations for Ozempic help Eli Lilly? Good news for Ozempic almost certainly means good news for Lilly's Mounjaro also.\\n\\nLike Ozempic, Mounjaro is approved for treating type 2 diabetes. Also like Ozempic, Lilly's drug is frequently prescribed off-label for helping patients lose weight. Soaring demand for Mounjaro has resulted in supply shortages as well.\\n\\nWith Novo Nordisk now projecting increased sales growth for Ozempic (and Wegovy), it's very likely that Lilly's sales of Mounjaro will be higher than expected, too. Novo's guidance hike will also potentially ratchet up the intense anticipation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval decision for Mounjaro in weight loss, which could come by early 2024 and perhaps even sooner.\\n\\nLilly added fuel to the fire of investors' enthusiasm about Mounjaro over the last weekend. On Sunday, the company released detailed results from a late-stage study that showed Mounjaro helped patients lose on average 26.6% of their body weight over an 84-week period.\\n\\nIs Eli Lilly stock a buy?\\n\\nIt's rare that pharmaceutical products attract the widespread attention that Ozempic and Mounjaro have. Wall Street analysts even predict that Mounjaro could become the world's top-selling drug with annual sales of over $50 billion.\\n\\nBut does all of the hoopla mean that Eli Lilly stock is a buy? There's an argument to be made that it isn't. The consensus 12-month price target for Lilly is a little lower than the current share price.\\n\\nAnalysts appear to be concerned that most of Lilly's near-term growth potential is already baked into the share price after the stock's impressive performance this year. They could be right. Lilly's shares trade at a sky-high forward earnings multiple of close to 48x.\\n\\nHowever, it's probably going to take a few years for Mounjaro to reach peak sales. In the meantime, Lilly has other growth drivers, notably including cancer drug Verzenio and type 2 diabetes drug Jardiance. The company also hopes to soon win regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for its next potential mega-blockbuster, Alzheimer's disease drug donanemab.\\n\\nMy view is that Lilly stock remains a great pick for long-term investors. And I fully expect the sales for both Ozempic and Mounjaro will continue to climb.\", \"article summary\": \"Our expensive obesity drugs are worth it, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly argue in raft of studiesDALLAS \\u2014 Here at ObesityWeek, one of the largest conferences on obesity, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are displaying more than a dozen studies that together carry the message: Our blockbuster weight loss treatments will be worth it for society.\\nBut experts point out that much of this company-funded research does not include the cost of the drugs themselves, which sell at more than $10,000 per year in the U.S. and are meant to be taken indefinitely.\\nadvertisementThe two major pharmaceutical companies have seen interest skyrocket for their GLP-1-based drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro, a new generation of medications that can cut substantial amounts of weight.\\nBut insurance plans have been slow to grant wide access to obesity treatments, concerned that the vast amount of people eligible to take them, along with their high price, could lead to significant financial strain.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"drug\"}, \"maxValues\": {\"title\": \"Will Ozempic-type obesity drugs pay off for society?

Patients taking Eli Lilly 's Mounjaro were significantly more likely to lose 5%, 10% and 15% of their body weight overall and saw larger reductions in body weight after three months, six months and a year compared with those on Novo Nordisk 's Ozempic in the study by Truveta Research. The firm compiles and analyzes patient data from a collective of health-care systems. The results from the study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, come as both drugs and similar treatments approved for weight loss soar in demand in the U.S. for their ability to help patients shed unwanted pounds over time. Mounjaro and Ozempic are only approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, but many people use the weekly injections off-label to lose weight. A spokesperson for Eli Lilly said the company does not promote or encourage off-label use of any of its medicines and noted that the new study was not sponsored by the drugmaker.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nA Novo Nordisk spokesperson similarly said that the company was not involved in the study. They also said the study does not consider that Ozempic is administered at slightly lower doses than its weight-loss drug counterpart, Wegovy. Both drugs contain the active ingredient semaglutide. Meanwhile, Mounjaro and another version of the drug approved for weight loss called Zepbound are the same medicine with the same dosage level, the spokesperson added. Previous head-to-head studies have similarly suggested that Mounjaro is more effective than Ozempic for weight loss and controlling blood sugar in adults with Type 2 diabetes. But Monday's study suggests that Mounjaro has an edge over Ozempic in a real-world setting, specifically among adults who are overweight or obese. Notably, head-to-head clinical trials in that population are not yet available, according to Truveta Research. Eli Lilly is pitting Zepbound and Wegovy in an ongoing clinical trial in obese or overweight patients. But results won't be released until 2025. \\\"We've been able to compare the head-to-head efficacy of these two important medications for weight loss in advance of randomized clinical trials,\\\" said Dr. Nick Stucky, an author of the study and vice president of Truveta Research, in a statement. \\\"This study can help to inform patient care and outcomes today, not months from now.\\\"\\n\\nStudy results on Mounjaro and Ozempic\\n\\nTruveta Research specifically examined health-care data on roughly 18,000 adults who are overweight or obese and first started taking Mounjaro or Ozempic between May 2022 and September 2023. Nearly 52% of those patients had Type 2 diabetes. Researchers found that patients taking Mounjaro were three times more likely to lose 15% of their weight than those on Ozempic. Patients on Mounjaro were also 2.6 times more likely to achieve 10% weight loss and 1.8 times more likely to lose 5% of their weight.\\n\\nThose taking Mounjaro also experienced \\\"significantly larger reductions\\\" in body weight at specific time points, according to Truveta Research. At three months, patients on Mounjaro lost 5.9% of their weight, while those on Ozempic lost 3.6%. At six months, people taking Mounjaro lost 10.1% of their weight, while patients on Ozempic lost 5.9%. And at one year, those on Mounjaro lost 15.2% of their weight, while those on Ozempic lost 7.9%.

The active ingredient in Zepbound, tirzepatide, is already approved under the brand name Mounjaro to help improve blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes and is widely prescribed off-label for weight loss.\\n\\nZepbound and Mounjaro are similar to the better-known Wegovy and Ozempic, which are both manufactured by Danish company Novo Nordisk. All of these drugs mimic a naturally occurring hormone in the body called GLP-1. Produced in the gut, GLP-1 lowers blood sugar, slows the emptying of the stomach, and regulates appetite. Zepbound and Mounjaro also act on a similar hormone called GIP to reduce food intake.\\n\\nGLP-1 drugs were initially developed to treat type 2 diabetes but are increasingly being used for weight loss.

The drug comes in preloaded injector pens containing different doses, and patients must start out with a low-dose pen before gradually stepping up to higher doses. The drugmaker is restricting supply of those low-dose injections so it can focus on serving current patients as it works to boost production capacity.\\n\\nWith the FDA\\u2019s approval of Zepbound, people seeking to lose weight now have another option.

Prior research had linked these types of blood sugar changes with a worsening of a common diabetes complication called diabetic retinopathy, which can threaten vision.\\n\\nSo, could people taking Ozempic and Wegovy experience any new-onset diabetic retinopathy, or a worsening of existing retinopathy?\\n\\nTo find out, a team led by Dr. Zeeshan Haq, of Retina Consultants of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, tracked outcomes for more than 48,000 adults with type 2 diabetes. The participants ranged in age from 51 to 75, and all had been treated with injectable semaglutide.\\n\\nHaq's team found that within two years of starting the treatment, only 2.2% of patients went on to develop a new retinopathy or showed a worsening of existing retinopathy.\\n\\nFocusing on a subset of patients who'd already been diagnosed with early-stage retinopathy, the Minneapolis researchers found that just 3.5% showed any worsening of their disease.\\n\\nAnd among those who'd had an advanced form of diabetic retinopathy at the start of the study, 60% actually saw an improvement in their eye illness, the researchers noted.\\n\\nAlthough more study is needed to draw definite conclusions, Haq said these initial findings are promising.\\n\\nHowever, in a news release from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, he advised that, for now, \\\"diabetic patients who are considering semaglutide should consult with their primary and eye care providers regarding their individual situation.\\\"\\n\\nThe newly published trial is a retrospective look at the data. A prospective clinical trial\\u2014the gold standard\\u2014is being conducted to determine whether semaglutide might affect the vision of people who also take standard diabetes medications. That trial is set to conclude in early 2027, Haq's team said.\\n\\nThe findings were presented at this month's meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in San Francisco.

For more than a decade, research has emerged that similar drugs used to treat diabetes have a surprising side-effect: They make people want to drink less alcohol\\u2014way less.\\n\\nThe apparent effectiveness of drugs like semaglutide won\\u2019t come as a surprise to doctors who have been prescribing these drugs to patients for years. In 2011, researchers in India found that a drug called liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor used to treat diabetes, significantly reduced alcohol intake in a small group of patients. In fact, nine of the 63 participants surveyed had stopped drinking altogether.\\n\\nHints that these kinds of drugs could be used in the treatment of alcoholism go back even further. The first GLP-1 receptor agonist came on the market back in 2005 in the form of exenatide, and the accompanying waning thirst for alcohol has been reported anecdotally over and over ever since. \\u201cSome of [the patients] wanted to have a break going on holidays, because they wanted to be able to enjoy a glass of red wine,\\u201d says Mette Kruse Klausen, a postdoctoral researcher at the Psychiatric Centre Copenhagen in Denmark. If it were the case that this already-approved, safe drug could stem alcohol cravings, its potential to treat alcohol use disorder, or AUD\\u2014estimated to afflict over 280 million people worldwide\\u2014was tantalizing.\\n\\nFollow-up research was slow. First, researchers had to test the application out on animals, which they did\\u2014and it did show promise in using GLP-1 receptor agonists for reducing alcohol intake.\\n\\nResearch in humans followed: A randomized clinical trial in Denmark led by Kruse Klausen started in 2017 looking at treating patients with AUD with exenatide. It worked with 127 patients with AUD; half got exenatide, half a placebo. A setback followed: Researchers found that exenatide did not lead to a reduction in the number of heavy-drinking days between the two groups.\\n\\nResearchers working on the study theorized that the lack of efficacy could have been due to the cognitive behavioral therapy offered to both groups. Another factor could have been that severity of the patients\\u2019 AUD was lower than that of other trials looking at treatments for AUD\\u2014and research on interventions for people with AUD is just difficult to do, says Kruse Klausen, due to the high dropout rate.

These are the kind of policy approaches that could be a game changer for obesity management and diabetes care while this country continues to work on the bigger problem: our poverty of imagination for the ethical care of all bodies.\\n\\nFor now, cash-strapped American consumers are left to contend with a society in which the price of being fat is so high that there will always be a rational reason to pay an exorbitant amount to be thin.\\n\\nThere is weight loss for health. There is also weight loss for status and avoiding stigma. While both men and women experience greater discrimination if they are fat, women suffer more for failing to be thin enough. Study after study shows that overweight women are more likely to be unemployed than their thinner counterparts. When they are employed, larger women earn less, with smaller penalties for Black and Hispanic women, who already earn less, on average. Overweight white and Asian women experience the labor market discrimination that Black and Hispanic women already do.\\n\\nOutside of the workplace, the trend of educational and economic elites marrying, befriending and socializing with one another \\u2014 assortative matching and mating \\u2014 is also a marked characteristic of our time. Elite homogeneity has a look, and the look is thin. So when women say that it is better to be sick and thin than healthy and fat, they are perfectly rational.\", \"article summary\": \"In this latest study, researchers looked at the side effects of both Ozempic and other semaglutide drugs, as well as Victoza (liraglutide), which also has been linked to stomach paralysis risks in past studies.\\nThe researchers compared incidence rates of gastrointestinal problems among 4,144 liraglutide users and 612 semaglutide users with 654 users of Contrave (bupropion-naltrexone).\\nThe study focused on those who used the drugs for weight loss, which has become an increasing trend nationwide.\\nAccording to their findings, Ozempic and Victoza users faced a nine-fold increased risk of pancreatitis, four times the risk of bowel obstruction, and more than three times the risk of gastroparesis, or stomach paralysis, than those who took Contrave.\\nThe first known Ozempic gastroparesis lawsuit was filed in early August, alleging Novo Nordisk knew about the risks, but failed to provide patients and healthcare providers with adequate warning.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"americans\"}, \"maxValues\": {\"title\": \"Side Effects of Ozempic, Wegovy, Similar Drugs Increase Risk of ... - AboutLawsuits.com\", \"description\": \"Side Effects of Ozempic, Wegovy, Similar Drugs Increase Risk of ...

Compounding pharmacies prepare custom-made versions of commercially available treatments to meet the specific needs of a patient.\\n\\nThe Danish drugmaker found that all the products tested from Wells Pharmacy Network and Brooksville Pharmaceuticals were impure, meaning that they contained unknown and unauthorized substances other than semaglutide, according to the two lawsuits filed in federal court in Florida. One product's level of unknown impurities was 33%.\\n\\nThe unknown impurities in the products \\\"potentially pose safety risks\\\" to consumers, including \\\"possibly serious and life-threatening reactions,\\\" Novo Nordisk said in the suits.\\n\\nThe Danish drugmaker is not seeking monetary damages but is asking the court to bar the pharmacies from selling their products.\\n\\nWells Pharmacy Network and Brooksville Pharmaceuticals did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.\\n\\nNovo Nordisk first sued Brooksville Pharmaceuticals over copycat versions of Wegovy and Ozempic in July. A federal judge in Florida dismissed the suit in October and later gave the drugmaker time to refile its complaint against the pharmacy.\\n\\nIncluding the newest lawsuits, Novo Nordisk has filed 12 legal actions against compounding pharmacies, medical spas and weight loss clinics allegedly selling dupes of Wegovy and Ozempic. The company said it has received preliminary injunctions in six of those cases.\\n\\nRival Eli Lilly has taken similar action against businesses selling knockoffs of its popular diabetes drug Mounjaro, including its own lawsuit against Wells Pharmacy Network.\\n\\nNovo Nordisk's new suit against Wells Pharmacy Network claims that its products contained a substance called BPC-157, which was banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September.
