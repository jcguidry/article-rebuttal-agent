Meanwhile, the findings come at a time when employers are still struggling to fill positions amid near-historic low unemployment rates of 3.6%, even though the frenzied talent war years of the Great Resignation have subsided a bit.\\n\\nEmployers that offered full flexibility on whether employees wanted to come into the office grew their headcount by 5.6% in the past 12 months, according to data gleaned from Scoop\\u2019s Flex Index and People Data Lab\\u2019s hiring data. That was substantially higher than the 2.6% headcount growth at employers that required five days per week in the office.\\n\\nContributing factors for lower headcount growth\\n\\nDan Kaplan, senior client partner for executive recruiting firm Korn Ferry\\u2019s CHRO practice, notes a number of factors are likely behind the lower growth for employers with full-time RTO requirements.\\n\\nOrganizations that are requiring workers to return full-time to the office may reflect leadership that believes threats of a recession are tipping the scales in employers\\u2019 favor. Along those lines, employee surveys continually show that CEO empathy toward their workforce is in decline since the height of COVID, Kaplan says\\u2014though empathy remains a critical component of talent attraction.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\n\\u201cCEOs who helped lead the world through COVID are becoming a little bit more tone-deaf around empathy, holding the view that \\u2018COVID is now over and enough of the childish games and let\\u2019s just get back into the office and get back to work,\\u2019 \\u201d Kaplan explains.\\n\\nHe also notes an inability to attract candidates may point to a larger issue of sub-par employee engagement, or even quiet quitting.\\n\\nThese are issues that HR can help open up discussion about, even at companies that are undergoing layoffs, hiring freezes or other cost-containment measures. And organizations with a full-time return-to-office policy need to pay particular attention to the potential impact on talent attraction, Kaplan tells HRE.\\n\\n\\u201cCHROs should be concerned with both the data around the hiring growth and spend a lot of time talking with their recruiting team to understand the feedback in the market, the feedback from candidates and the feedback from employees,\\u201d he says. \\u201cPeople, one way or another, will vote with their feet.\\u201d\\n\\nHow HR leaders can make their case with the CEO\\n\\nMany CHROs today are caught in the middle: facing a CEO who wants a full-time, in-office workforce and even may back RTO enforcement measures, and an employee base largely against such moves. For HR leaders concerned about the impact of RTO on recruiting and retention, Kaplan offers several suggestions.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s largely been missing in this tug-of-war between the employees and CEO is an empowered HR function,\\u201d Kaplan tells HRE. \\u201cThey need to really gear up and go have that tough conversation with the CEO again and again and again and bring data.

Scores of people were present, and the office was busy. Intrigued, I asked about Zoom\\u2019s work-from-home policy. I was told that many local employees were on a hybrid schedule, typically coming in a couple of days a week. Recently, Zoom formalized this. Employees living within 50 miles are required to work in the office twice a week. There is no requirement, however, for employees living more than 50 miles away.\\n\\nThe headlines could have read \\u201cZoom confirms work-from-home three days a week for employees within 50 miles and five days for those outside 50 miles.\\u201d But sadly, these types of subtleties are harder to get across. Companies like Amazon, Meta, Salesforce and Zoom discovered that many of their best performers love working from home and that enforcing a five-day-a-week return to the office would have meant culling their top talent.\\n\\nWhat about the future? Could a recession and a change in our historically tight job market give bosses the upper hand and roll back these gains? I doubt it. Indeed, in 10 years, remote work is likely to increase, driven by two powerful economic forces.\\n\\nFirst, U.S. data going back to the 1960s reveals a mere 0.4 percent of full days were worked from home in 1965. That doubled roughly every 15 years until 2019, driven by improving technology. First came personal computers in the 1980s, then laptops in the 1990s. The internet opened up more possibilities in the 2000s, followed by cloud file sharing and video calls in the 2010s.\\n\\nAs one of four children of two working parents, I saw what working from home was like without a computer or the internet. My parents would sporadically have to work from home when there were child-care emergencies, and it was challenging. In the 1980s remote work required carrying loads of paperwork to and from the office, and it meant being excluded from meetings and decisions at work. Now we can Zoom in on laptops, share files via the cloud and easily connect with colleagues. This rate of technological progress is accelerating, as higher rates of remote working lead companies to develop ever better software and hardware.\", \"article summary\": \"Employees living within 50 miles are required to work in the office twice a week.\\nThere is no requirement, however, for employees living more than 50 miles away.\\nIndeed, in 10 years, remote work is likely to increase, driven by two powerful economic forces.\\nIn the 1980s remote work required carrying loads of paperwork to and from the office, and it meant being excluded from meetings and decisions at work.\\nThis rate of technological progress is accelerating, as higher rates of remote working lead companies to develop ever better software and hardware.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"50\"}, \"maxValues\": {\"title\": \"Work from home rates have dropped to a pandemic-era low of 26% as employers make returning to the office their north star - Fortune\", \"description\": \"Work from home rates have dropped to a pandemic-era low of 26% as employers make returning to the office their north star  Fortune\", \"published date\": \"2023-10-16\", \"url\": \"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9leHBlY3RpbmctcmV0dXJuLW9mZmljZS1ib29zdC13b3JrZXItMTYyNDM5MzAyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en\", \"publisher.href\": \"https://www.nytimes.com\", \"publisher.title\": \"Yahoo Finance\", \"query end date\": \"2023-12-07T03:12:20.091268\", \"published datetime\": \"2023-10-16T07:00:00\", \"article text\": \"\", \"article summary\": \"\\u201cThe idea that if you bring everyone into this mandatory [office] environment, working shoulder to shoulder, magical outcomes will come\\u2014that\\u2019s a silly thing,\\u201d Dean said.\\n\\u201cIt feels like magical thinking.\\u201d Dean spoke alongside Dropbox\\u2019s vice president of design Alastair Simpson, GitLab\\u2019s former head of remote work Darren Murph, and Monica Ballesteros, a senior manager at research firm Economist Impact.\\nDean, who once led remote work efforts at Meta, is one of the most ardent supporters of flexible work\\u2014and she isn\\u2019t a bandwagon fan.\\nA Ph.D. behavior scientist and research team carry out experiments on the best practices for optimized distributed work and report back to Dean.\\nWhile forced returns can lead to resentment, presenteeism, and\\u2014most of all\\u2014churn, distributed work has a long list of benefits, Dean\\u2019s research has found.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"zoom\"}, \"nullCount\": {\"title\": 0, \"description\": 0, \"published date\": 0, \"url\": 0, \"publisher.href\": 0, \"publisher.title\": 0, \"query end date\": 0, \"published datetime\": 0, \"article text\": 0, \"article html\": 0, \"article summary\": 0, \"article keywords.list.item\": 0}}","tags":null,"deletionVector":null,"baseRowId":null,"defaultRowCommitVersion":null,"clusteringProvider":null}}

They are more likely to live in small or shared apartments, which reduces the appeal of work from home.\\u201d\\n\\nFrom a younger employee\\u2019s perspective, work from home often means \\u201cyou get to sit in your studio apartment in front of your laptop, and good luck\\u2014you\\u2019re cut off from everything else,\\u201d venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said last year at the American Dynamism Summit, warning that remote work has \\u201cdetonated\\u201d the way we connect as a society.\\n\\nAs for older workers, they may be less keen to work from home \\u201cbecause they no longer have childcare responsibilities, or simply because they like to socialize at the workplace,\\u201d noted Bloom and his fellow researchers.\\n\\nIn the return-to-office debate, \\u201cwe\\u2019ve treated things monolithically,\\u201d Hung Lee, founder of the Recruiting Brainfood newsletter, told the a16z podcast. \\u201cBut we\\u2019re probably at the point now where we need to bring in the nuance, because what is positive for one group of people is negative for another.\\u201d\\n\\nHe pointed to surveys showing that, among university seniors entering the workforce, nearly 90% said they wanted to frequently meet in person with coworkers to network and build relationships. A third said they lack a dedicated workspace, and nearly 60% said they don\\u2019t have all the equipment they need at home. Only 2% said they wanted fully remote work.\\n\\nThe people who are most in favor of remote work, Lee added, are often senior workers with plenty of experience who\\u2019ve already built up social capital and have an effective workspace at home\\u2014and often have children they want to be near.\\n\\n\\u201cThey don\\u2019t feel they need to come to the office in order to make friends,\\u201d he noted.\\n\\nAs Bloom and his team observed, \\u201cPeople who live with children value the ability to work from home more highly\\u2026The effect holds for men and women and is pervasive across countries.\\u201d\\n\\nThat preference translates to more working from home among that demographic.\\n\\n\\u201cMoving from preferences to outcomes,\\u201d they wrote, \\u201cwe find that people with children do indeed work from home at higher rates.\\u201d\", \"article summary\": \"So on average, North Americans have decided they are in the new normal.\\u201dIn other words, hybrid work has emerged victorious.\\nGen Zers and boomers\\u2014a rare alliance\\u2014want to work more in the office, while millennials place more value on working from home, according to new research from Bloom and others.\\nIn the return-to-office debate, \\u201cwe\\u2019ve treated things monolithically,\\u201d Hung Lee, founder of the Recruiting Brainfood newsletter, told the a16z podcast.\\nOnly 2% said they wanted fully remote work.\\n\\u201cMoving from preferences to outcomes,\\u201d they wrote, \\u201cwe find that people with children do indeed work from home at higher rates.\\u201d\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"zers\"}, \"nullCount\": {\"title\": 0, \"description\": 0, \"published date\": 0, \"url\": 0, \"publisher.href\": 0, \"publisher.title\": 0, \"query end date\": 0, \"published datetime\": 0, \"article text\": 0, \"article html\": 0, \"article summary\": 0, \"article keywords.list.item\": 0}}","tags":null,"deletionVector":null,"baseRowId":null,"defaultRowCommitVersion":null,"clusteringProvider":null}}

But trying to book a conference room to do just that has proven to be consistently difficult, employees told the outlet. There simply are not enough rooms for the number of staff, it appears.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ve worked to address this with more collaborative spaces and workstations that allow for video calls and focused work,\\u201d a Meta spokesman told Insider. \\u201cIt\\u2019s important to note that we have roughly 80 offices around the world and our working to make sure our teams have the best experience possible as we welcome people back to the office.\\u201d\\n\\nFortune reached out to Meta for comments but received no immediate reply.\\n\\nEmployees have also had difficulties securing a desk for sufficient periods of time. Last year, Meta adopted a desk-sharing strategy that allowed people who still worked remotely to book a desk as needed. Now, employees called into the office sometimes have to switch from one desk to another before the day is over. This could feel especially disruptive to those accustomed to a familiar home office. A Meta spokesperson told Insider that desks can be booked a week in advance for up to three days in a row.\\n\\nBut as Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, wrote on Threads: \\u201cWe have not yet figured out hybrid work. Assigned desks mean lots of empty chairs. Hotel desks mean lots of unfamiliar faces. Pods are good for privacy but take up a ton of space.

Frustration quickly mounts in the corner office when a gleaming headquarters in a high-rent area goes largely unused by employees who feel more productive working at home. The result can be return-to-office mandates that are ignored, cause tension, or, worse, spur top talent to leave the company.\\n\\nOne way to fix the problem is to rethink office space entirely, suggests the experience of Atlassian. The global software firm, which makes collaboration tools such as Jira and has a $48 billion market cap, adopted a \\u201cTeam Anywhere\\u201d policy in 2020 and has stuck with it\\u2014bucking the trend of more companies enforcing return-to-office mandates this year.\\n\\n\\u201cWe expect people to be able to work from home, from a caf\\u00e9, from an office, but we don\\u2019t really care where they do their work\\u2014what we care about is the output that they produce,\\u201d co-CEO Scott Farquhar told Australia\\u2019s 60 Minutes program in August, adding, \\u201cI might come into the office about once a quarter.\\u201d\\n\\nAnnie Dean, who oversees real estate and workplace experience at Atlassian, noted that 40% of company employees live more than two hours away from an office, the workforce lives in 13 different countries, and remote hires (those who live two hours or more from an office) jumped from 14% in 2020 to 54% in 2023.\\n\\nOf course, Atlassian makes collaboration tools, so embracing remote teams itself makes sense. Today the company announced its acquisition of video messaging service Loom for $975 million. \\u201cTeaming up with Loom helps distributed teams communicate in deeply human ways,\\u201d said Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian cofounder and co-CEO, in a statement.\\n\\nYet despite the emphasis on remote work, the company still has ambitious plans for new offices, including in Seattle and Sydney, where it\\u2019s broken ground on a 40-story headquarters.\\n\\nDean believes companies just need a different way of evaluating their office space.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\\u201cWhen you treat your offices like a product\\u2014meaning you ensure that it meets the needs of your users\\u2014you can drive operational efficiency and ROI for your offices, while still providing employees with flexibility to choose where they can work best every day,\\u201d she told Commercial Observer this week.\\n\\nFor its upcoming Sydney headquarters, Atlassian is focused on collaborative spaces, knowing it will need to accommodate large teams occasionally gathering for meetups. It\\u2019s also using new metrics when evaluating its real estate strategy, including cost per visit and the degree to which employees utilize an office and engage within it.\\n\\nMany business leaders, of course, have soured on remote work, even if they initially embraced it. Paul Graham, cofounder of the Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, commented on the trend this summer.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve talked to multiple founders recently who have changed their minds about remote work and are trying to get people back to the office,\\u201d he wrote on X. \\u201cWhy were all these smart people fooled? Partly I think because remote work does work initially, if you start with a system already healthy from in-person work\\u2026and partly because it seemed to solve recruiting, which is always a bottleneck.\\u201d\\n\\nCompanies that embrace fully remote work do have a larger talent pool to draw from because they are not limited to only those potential employees who happen to live in one particular area.
