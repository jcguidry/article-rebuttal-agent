The big drugmaker reported strong revenue and earnings growth in its second-quarter results. Its shares have jumped more than 50% year to date.\\n\\nThe story continues to get even better. Ozempic sales are skyrocketing faster than expected. That's obviously good for Novo Nordisk. Here's why it's also great news for Eli Lilly (LLY 0.19%) stock, which has soared even more than Novo Nordisk's shares have so far in 2023.\\n\\nHigher and higher\\n\\nLast week, Novo Nordisk raised its full-year outlook for 2023. The company now projects sales will jump between 32% and 38%, up from its previous guidance of sales growth of 27% to 33%. Novo also anticipates operating profit will increase between 40% and 46%. Its prior forecast was for operating profit growth of 31% to 37%.\\n\\nThere's no big surprise why Novo Nordisk is more optimistic about its full-year prospects. The company stated that the revised guidance reflects higher sales expectations for type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic and its sibling, weight-loss drug Wegovy.\\n\\nOzempic and Wegovy are different brand names for the same underlying drug-semaglutide. The key distinctions between the two are the indications for which they're approved and their dosage levels.\\n\\nDoctors can (and many often do) legally prescribe Ozempic for weight loss as well as for type 2 diabetes. Ozempic became wildly popular with celebrities publicly talking about their use of the drug to lose weight. This even led to supply shortages.\\n\\nHow Lilly benefits from Ozempic's success\\n\\nHow does Novo Nordisk's greater expectations for Ozempic help Eli Lilly? Good news for Ozempic almost certainly means good news for Lilly's Mounjaro also.\\n\\nLike Ozempic, Mounjaro is approved for treating type 2 diabetes. Also like Ozempic, Lilly's drug is frequently prescribed off-label for helping patients lose weight. Soaring demand for Mounjaro has resulted in supply shortages as well.\\n\\nWith Novo Nordisk now projecting increased sales growth for Ozempic (and Wegovy), it's very likely that Lilly's sales of Mounjaro will be higher than expected, too. Novo's guidance hike will also potentially ratchet up the intense anticipation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval decision for Mounjaro in weight loss, which could come by early 2024 and perhaps even sooner.\\n\\nLilly added fuel to the fire of investors' enthusiasm about Mounjaro over the last weekend. On Sunday, the company released detailed results from a late-stage study that showed Mounjaro helped patients lose on average 26.6% of their body weight over an 84-week period.\\n\\nIs Eli Lilly stock a buy?\\n\\nIt's rare that pharmaceutical products attract the widespread attention that Ozempic and Mounjaro have. Wall Street analysts even predict that Mounjaro could become the world's top-selling drug with annual sales of over $50 billion.\\n\\nBut does all of the hoopla mean that Eli Lilly stock is a buy? There's an argument to be made that it isn't. The consensus 12-month price target for Lilly is a little lower than the current share price.\\n\\nAnalysts appear to be concerned that most of Lilly's near-term growth potential is already baked into the share price after the stock's impressive performance this year. They could be right. Lilly's shares trade at a sky-high forward earnings multiple of close to 48x.\\n\\nHowever, it's probably going to take a few years for Mounjaro to reach peak sales. In the meantime, Lilly has other growth drivers, notably including cancer drug Verzenio and type 2 diabetes drug Jardiance. The company also hopes to soon win regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for its next potential mega-blockbuster, Alzheimer's disease drug donanemab.\\n\\nMy view is that Lilly stock remains a great pick for long-term investors. And I fully expect the sales for both Ozempic and Mounjaro will continue to climb.\", \"article summary\": \"Our expensive obesity drugs are worth it, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly argue in raft of studiesDALLAS \\u2014 Here at ObesityWeek, one of the largest conferences on obesity, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are displaying more than a dozen studies that together carry the message: Our blockbuster weight loss treatments will be worth it for society.\\nBut experts point out that much of this company-funded research does not include the cost of the drugs themselves, which sell at more than $10,000 per year in the U.S. and are meant to be taken indefinitely.\\nadvertisementThe two major pharmaceutical companies have seen interest skyrocket for their GLP-1-based drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro, a new generation of medications that can cut substantial amounts of weight.\\nBut insurance plans have been slow to grant wide access to obesity treatments, concerned that the vast amount of people eligible to take them, along with their high price, could lead to significant financial strain.\", \"article keywords.list.item\": \"drug\"}, \"maxValues\": {\"title\": \"Will Ozempic-type obesity drugs pay off for society?

Those treatments, known as GLP-1s, mimic a hormone in the gut to suppress a person's appetite.\\n\\nBut the rate of future prescription volumes will largely depend on whether manufacturers of those drugs, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly , can resolve widespread supply shortages affecting most of their treatments in the U.S., among other factors, according to the report.\\n\\nThe analysis is based on insurance claims data for about 300 million Americans. Among the other drugs prescribed are Eli Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro and an older GLP-1 drug from Novo Nordisk called Saxenda, which isn't as effective for weight loss as Ozempic and Wegovy.\\n\\nBut the total number of GLP-1 prescriptions is likely an undercount since some health plans don't cover weight loss treatments like Wegovy, leaving some patients to pay for them out of pocket.\\n\\nSome people, such as Hollywood celebrities and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, are wealthy enough to pay for the drugs themselves.\\n\\nOzempic's list price tops $935 per monthly package, and its weight loss counterpart Wegovy is about $1,300.

It doesn't appear to be the case after Novo Nordisk (NVO -2.05%) announced its results for the first nine months of 2023 on Thursday morning.\\n\\nOzempic sales soared in the third quarter. Unsurprisingly, investors reacted positively to Novo Nordisk's results, with the big drugmaker's shares jumping nearly 4% in early trading.\\n\\nHowever, Eli Lilly (LLY 0.19%) reported its Q3 results on Thursday as well, and its share price jumped close to 7%. Is Lilly a better stock to buy than Novo Nordisk?\\n\\nNovo Nordisk's sizzling quarter\\n\\n\\\"Sensational\\\" might be the best word to describe Ozempic's recent performance. Novo Nordisk announced that the type 2 diabetes drug raked in Q3 sales of 23.9 million kroner (around $2.1 billion), up 56% year over year using a constant exchange rate.\\n\\nHowever, Ozempic's sibling, Wegovy, delivered even more impressive growth. The two products use different doses of the same underlying drug: semaglutide. While Ozempic is frequently prescribed as an off-label treatment for weight loss, Wegovy is approved for the indication. Wegovy's Q3 sales topped 9.6 billion kroner (nearly $900 million), up from 1.1 billion kroner (a little over $100 million) in the prior-year period.\\n\\nNovo Nordisk's total sales in Q3 increased by 29% year over year on a reported basis and 38% using constant exchange rates. The company raised its full-year growth outlook in October and continues to expect sales will jump between 32% and 38% in 2023 on a constant-currency basis.\\n\\nEli Lilly blew the doors off in Q3, too\\n\\nWhile Novo Nordisk's Q3 results were very good, Eli Lilly reported even better numbers. Lilly's Q3 revenue soared 37% year over year to nearly $9.5 billion. The company's type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro continued to gain ground on Ozempic, racking up sales of $1.4 billion in Q3.\\n\\nLilly's lineup includes several other rising stars, though. Sales for breast cancer drug Verzenio vaulted 68% higher year over year to over $1 billion. Type 2 diabetes drug Jardiance raked in nearly $701 million, up 22% from the prior-year period. The company also saw strong momentum for relatively new cancer drugs Retevmo and Tyvyt, with sales increases of 56% and 50%, respectively.\\n\\nDespite Lilly's tremendous revenue growth, the drugmaker's earnings plunged. Lilly posted a net loss of $57.4 million, or $0.06 per share, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Its non-GAAP earnings in Q3 declined by 95% year over year to only $94.8 million, or $0.10 per share.\\n\\nHowever, investors didn't bat an eye at this seemingly problematic trend. Why? The lower earnings numbers were due to $2.98 billion in charges related to Lilly's acquisitions of Dice Therapeutics, Emergence Therapeutics, and Versanis Bio. Without these nonrecurring expenses, Lilly would have delivered strong profit growth.\\n\\nBetter stock: Novo Nordisk or Eli Lilly?\\n\\nIf we only compared Novo Nordisk and Lilly on earnings-based valuation metrics, Novo would be the clear winner. Novo Nordisk's shares trade at 33 times expected earnings, while Lilly's forward earnings multiple of 43.5 is much higher.\\n\\nHowever, those metrics only factor in near-term growth. Over the next decade, I expect Lilly to generate significantly stronger growth than Novo Nordisk will.\\n\\nLilly already awaits regulatory approval for Mounjaro in chronic weight loss management. It's likely that Mounjaro's sales will quickly surpass Ozempic's if approved for weight loss. Lilly also hopes to soon win regulatory approval for donanemab in treating Alzheimer's disease. If approved, the drug would almost certainly become yet another blockbuster for the company.\\n\\nMy view is that Eli Lilly is the better stock to buy right now than Novo Nordisk.

But many of the 100 million American adults who are obese can't afford to pay out of pocket for the treatments, called GLP-1 agonists.\\n\\nKFF compared list prices \\u2014 the price a drugmaker sets before insurance or any discounts \\u2014 available through website searches.\\n\\nSome countries negotiate directly with drugmakers such as Novo Nordisk to set lower list prices for medications, according to Krutika Amin, associate director of the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. Meanwhile, other countries such as the U.S. do not, contributing to vastly different list prices.\\n\\nA 30-day supply of Novo Nordisk 's diabetes drug Ozempic, which is used off-label for weight loss, for example, has a list price of $936 in the U.S. That's five times as expensive as the $168 list price in Japan.\\n\\nThe list prices are even lower in other countries. Ozempic is priced at $103 in Germany, $96 in Sweden and $83 in France.\\n\\nNovo Nordisk's Wegovy, which has the same active ingredient as Ozempic and is approved for weight loss, has a list price of more than $1,300 in the U.S. Meanwhile, Wegovy's list price is just $328 in Germany.\\n\\nEli Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro, which is also used off-label for weight loss, has a list price of $1,023 in the U.S. but is just $319 in Japan and $444 in the Netherlands.\\n\\nRepresentatives for Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment Thursday.\\n\\nA Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the company's pricing decisions reflect the \\\"efficacy, innovation, extensive clinical trials, and clinical value we believe our products deliver.\\\" The company noted that outside of the U.S., countries have different regulatory requirements for pricing.\\n\\nNovo Nordisk is advocating for Medicare Part D to cover weight loss drugs and actively working with private insurers and employers to encourage broader coverage of the treatments, the spokesperson added.\\n\\nThese list prices and the patchy insurance coverage of weight-loss drugs in the U.S. undoubtedly affect accessibility. But a KFF survey released earlier this month suggests that they also affect patients' overall interest in the medications.\\n\\nThe survey found that nearly half of U.S. adults are generally interested in taking a prescription weight-loss drug, but that interest drops to 16% if the medication isn't covered by insurance.\\n\\nAbout 80% of adults in the survey said insurance companies should cover the cost of weight-loss drugs for adults who are overweight or obese, while half said insurers should cover the cost for anyone who wants to use them to lose weight.\\n\\nNew trial data released by Novo Nordisk last week could potentially put more pressure on U.S. insurers to cover weight-loss drugs.\\n\\nThe Danish company's trial found that Wegovy slashed the risk of serious heart problems and heart-related death by 20% in overweight or obese patients with established cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nThe results suggest that Wegovy and likely other obesity drugs have significant health benefits beyond shedding unwanted pounds.
