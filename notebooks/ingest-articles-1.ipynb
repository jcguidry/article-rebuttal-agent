Consequently, he had to pay the price, no matter how fair or unfair everybody believes it is.&quot;\n",

They are also prescribed off-label for weight loss.\\n\\nGLP-1 medications work, in part, by slowing how quickly food moves through the stomach, which can lead to a person feeling fuller longer. They can also, however, cause gastrointestinal issues, including abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, which have been well documented in clinical trials and are listed as potential side effects on drugs’ labels.\\n\\nJaclyn Bjorklund, 44, of Louisiana, is accusing the drugmakers of failing to disclose other health problems allegedly caused by the medications, including severe gastroparesis, also known as stomach paralysis, as well as “persistent” vomiting, Paul Pennock, an attorney, told reporters on a call Wednesday. Pennock is from the firm Morgan &amp; Morgan, based in Orlando, Florida, which is representing Bjorklund.\\n\\nGastroparesis is a condition that slows or stops the movement of food out of the stomach and into the small intestines. It’s sometimes referred to as “delayed gastric emptying,” according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The condition can be caused by underlying medical issues, and one of the more common causes of gastroparesis is diabetes, according to the American College of Gastroenterology. It can also result from infections or certain medications including narcotics and antidepressants.\\n\\nWhile “gastroparesis” is not mentioned in the prescribing information for Ozempic or Mounjaro, “delays gastric emptying” is listed on both drugs’ labels, because it can affect how other medications are absorbed by the body.\\n\\nThe Food and Drug Administration declined to comment on the lawsuit. In a statement, Chanapa Tantibanchachai, a spokesperson for the agency, said it is unclear whether the GLP-1 medications contribute to the occurrence of gastroparesis.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. Natalia Salomao, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, said the company was not aware of the lawsuit as of Wednesday morning. However, Salomao noted that gastroparesis is a known risk for people with diabetes.\\n\\n“Patient safety is of utmost importance to Novo Nordisk,” she said. “We recommend patients take these medications for their approved indications and under the supervision of a healthcare professional.”\\n\\nAbout 400 people have come forward claiming to have gastrointestinal injuries caused by the diabetes medications, said Pennock, who stated that he ultimately expects to see “thousands of such cases.”\\n\\nBjorklund was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2017 and had been prescribed Ozempic before later switching to Mounjaro.\\n\\nBjorklund is claiming that she was “severely injured” by the medications and had to go to the emergency room multiple times due to stomach problems, according to the lawsuit. She vomited so violently that she lost teeth, the suit claims.\\n\\nBjorklund hasn’t yet been diagnosed with gastroparesis, Pennock said, although he claimed her symptoms are “indicative of” the condition and dismissed that the condition was caused by her diabetes.\\n\\nShe is seeking “very significant” compensation from the drugmakers, Pennock added, declining to state a specific amount.\\n\\nDr. Shauna Levy, a specialist in obesity medicine and the medical director of the Tulane Bariatric Center in New Orleans, said she was surprised by the lawsuit.\\n\\nWhile the medications could cause gastroparesis, Levy, who is not involved with Bjorklund’s treatment, said that the problem could also be caused by another undiagnosed illness or by the patient’s diabetes, and then exacerbated by the medications.\\n\\n“As a provider, I’m not worried about this being a common problem,” Levy said.\\n\\nTantibanchachai said the FDA will continue to monitor for any potential adverse events from the medications.\\n\\n&quot;If newly identified safety signals are identified, the FDA will determine what actions are appropriate after a thorough review of the body of evidence,&quot; she said.\\n\\nFollow NBC HEALTH on Twitter &amp; Facebook.               </td></tr>\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: right;\"> 1</td><td>Harambe, Gorilla Killed at Cincinnati Zoo, &#x27;Had to Pay the Price&#x27;: Experts</td><td>https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harambe-gorilla-killed-cincinnati-zoo-had-pay-price-experts-n583146  </td><td>[&#x27;Https&#x27;, &#x27;Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms&#x27;, &#x27;Elizabeth Chuck&#x27;, &#x27;Elizabeth Chuck Is A Reporter For Nbc News Who Focuses On Health&#x27;, &#x27;Mental Health&#x27;, &#x27;Particularly Issues That Affect Women&#x27;]                                                                                                                                                        </td><td>en        </td><td>Some experts and activists say the Cincinnati Zoo was right to fatally shoot an endangered gorilla after a toddler fell into the animal&#x27;s enclosure.                                                  </td><td>              </td><td>[&#x27;killed&#x27;, &#x27;harambe&#x27;, &#x27;animals&#x27;, &#x27;zoos&#x27;, &#x27;cincinnati&#x27;, &#x27;gorillas&#x27;, &#x27;zoo&#x27;, &#x27;child&#x27;, &#x27;gorilla&#x27;, &#x27;price&#x27;, &#x27;hansen&#x27;, &#x27;experts&#x27;, &#x27;maynard&#x27;, &#x27;pay&#x27;]                                             </td><td>Despite outrage from the public, some experts and activists believe the Cincinnati Zoo was right to fatally shoot an endangered gorilla after a toddler fell into the animal&#x27;s enclosure.\\nCincinnati ZooMaynard said Monday that the Cincinnati Zoo had received an outpouring of support from colleagues around the world — including famed primatologist Jane Goodall.\\nCritics felt the zoo should have done more before killing Harambe, one of fewer than 175,000 western lowland gorillas worldwide.\\n&quot;Once again, an innocent animal pays the ultimate price for human stupidity,&quot; wrote a commenter on the Cincinnati Zoo&#x27;s Facebook page, where the zoo posted that it was &quot;heartbroken&quot; over Harambe&#x27;s death.\\nThe incident is the first time anyone has fallen through the barrier at Cincinnati Zoo&#x27;s Gorilla World since the exhibit opened in 1978, Maynard said.          </td><td>Despite outrage from the public, some experts and activists believe the Cincinnati Zoo was right to fatally shoot an endangered gorilla after a toddler fell into the animal&#x27;s enclosure.\\n\\nAll accredited zoos, such as Cincinnati&#x27;s, have protocols in place for when an animal threatens staff or visitors. In this case, the zoo had to decide whether to tranquilize 17-year-old Harambe, a 450-pound western lowland gorilla, or to use greater force, said Ed Hansen, CEO of the American Association of Zoo Keepers.\\n\\nA lethal shot comes with the risk of accidentally shooting the person you&#x27;re trying to save, but a tranquilizer dart could have taken up to 30 minutes to work and comes with other risks, Hansen said.\\n\\n&quot;The tranquilizer possibly could have worked, but the key term there is &#x27;possibly.&#x27; And if you were to fire a dart at an animal, he could react violently to the first opportunity that presents itself, and that would have been that small child,&quot; Hansen told NBC News. &quot;Unfortunately for the gorilla, the only really positive way to ensure the safety of the child was to dispatch the lethal force.&quot;\\n\\nThe Dangerous Animal Response Team first tried to coax Harambe out of the exhibit, according to zoo director Thane Maynard, but the team was only able to cajole the female gorillas away from the three-year-old, who slipped through the railing and plummeted more than 10 feet into the exhibit&#x27;s moat.\\n\\nHarambe alternated between gently pawing the boy and dragging him. The team resorted to killing him.\\n\\n&quot;We stand by our decision,&quot; Maynard said. &quot;We&#x27;d make the same decision today.&quot;\\n\\nHarambe, a 17-year-old male gorilla, was shot dead Saturday after a child fell into his enclosure. Cincinnati Zoo\\n\\nMaynard said Monday that the Cincinnati Zoo had received an outpouring of support from colleagues around the world — including famed primatologist Jane Goodall.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the Jane Goodall Institute published the email Goodall had sent to Maynard, which read in part: &quot;Dear Thane, I feel so sorry for you, having to try to defend something which you may well disapprove of ... it is a devastating loss to the zoo, and to the gorillas.&quot;\\n\\nCritics felt the zoo should have done more before killing Harambe, one of fewer than 175,000 western lowland gorillas worldwide. And many urged authorities to hold the boy&#x27;s parents criminally responsible: An online petition called &quot;Justice for Harambe&quot; had more than 330,000 signatures Tuesday.\\n\\n&quot;Once again, an innocent animal pays the ultimate price for human stupidity,&quot; wrote a commenter on the Cincinnati Zoo&#x27;s Facebook page, where the zoo posted that it was &quot;heartbroken&quot; over Harambe&#x27;s death.\\n\\nThe boy, who was not identified, was briefly hospitalized and is recovering, his family said. The mother, an administrator at a local daycare, has not been charged.\\n\\nCincinnati police are investigating whether criminal charges should be filed, Hamilton County prosecutor Joseph Deters said Tuesday.\\n\\nRelated: Killed Gorilla Seem to Protect Child Who Fell in Enclosure: Witness\\n\\nIt&#x27;s not unprecedented for children to survive falling into a gorilla enclosure without the gorilla being put down. In 1986, a 5-year-old in England was knocked unconscious after he fell into the exhibit at the Jersey Zoo. When he woke, his cries startled the gorilla, and zookeepers were able to move in and save him.\\n\\nThen in 1996, a 3-year-old tumbled into the gorilla enclosure at Chicago&#x27;s Brookfield Zoo, also losing consciousness. A female gorilla named Binti Jua picked him up and brought him directly to the exhibit&#x27;s door, right over to zookeepers.\\n\\nThe Cincinnati incident came barely a month after another zoo was pummeled by critics for its handling of a face-to-face encounter between a human and one of its animals.\\n\\nIn April, a zoo keeper in Palm Beach, Florida, was attacked by a Malayan tiger, and the zoo chose to tranquilize the endangered cat. Keeper Stacey Konwiser, 38, was airlifted in critical condition to a hospital, where she later died of her injuries.\\n\\nRelated: Palm Beach Zoo Under Fire for Tranquilizing Tiger in Fatal Mauling\\n\\nWhile gorillas aren&#x27;t carnivores like tigers are, Hansen of the American Association of Zoo Keepers said Harambe posed just as much of a threat of injuring the boy, either on purpose or inadvertently.\\n\\n&quot;It&#x27;s just the nature of the species. All animals in the zoo are wild animals, and their behaviors are instinctive,&quot; he said.\\n\\nHarambe&#x27;s former caretaker, Jerry Stones, who is facilities director at Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, said he didn&#x27;t think the gorilla intended to kill the child. But he agreed that Harambe&#x27;s actions would have been unpredictable.\\n\\n&quot;All of a sudden, he had something in his home that was something he had never had to deal with before. Was it something dangerous, was it something to play with, what was this thing?&quot; Stones, who met Harambe when he was just 21 days old, told NBC News. &quot;He&#x27;s so big that he could accidentally hurt that child, even if he didn&#x27;t mean to. Consequently, he had to pay the price, no matter how fair or unfair everybody believes it is.&quot;\\n\\nStones said Harambe&#x27;s death was &quot;just like losing a member of your family,&quot; but he didn&#x27;t second-guess the zoo&#x27;s decision.\\n\\nThe incident is the first time anyone has fallen through the barrier at Cincinnati Zoo&#x27;s Gorilla World since the exhibit opened in 1978, Maynard said.\\n\\nAnimal rights group PETA criticized the zoo for not having a stronger barrier and argued wild animals shouldn&#x27;t be taken out of their natural habitats to begin with.\\n\\n&quot;Even under the &#x27;best&#x27; circumstances, captivity is never acceptable for gorillas or other primates, and in cases like this, it&#x27;s even deadly,&quot; PETA said in a statement. &quot;This tragedy is exactly why PETA urges families to stay away from any facility that displays animals as sideshows for humans to gawk at.&quot;               </td></tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>'"
